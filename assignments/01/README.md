# Assignment 1: Training and Evaluating a Basic NMT System

In this assignment we use sv-en data from the Infopankki
corpus to train our model and then evaluate performance on
both in-domain and out-of-domain data.

All data has been prepared for the experiments so you just
need to train the model and translate the different test
sets.

Take a look at the instructions in the main README for more
information on how to do this.
