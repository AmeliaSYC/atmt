Information about KokkolaFinnish _ Swedish _ English
History
Kokkola has been the location of a port, a shipyard and a centre of trade since the Middle Ages.
The rising of the land has been a key factor in the history of Kokkola.
It has shaped the environment significantly and affected the development of the port and commerce, for example.
Trading took place along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and farming, hunting, fishing and seal hunting were also important sources of livelihood.
The tar export business, later to become crucial to the history of Kokkola, began as early as in the 16th century.
On 7th September 1620, the Swedish king Gustav Adolf II signed a document transforming the small Ristiranta village, known for fishing and farming, into a town.
At the time, the current Kaupunginsalmi narrow was a slender bay that extended as far as the Kirkonmäki hill.
Little by little, Kokkola developed into an important location for shipping and ship building.
There were shipyards in Kaustarinlahti, Mustakari and Soldatskär, for example.
At first, ship routes only covered Turku and Stockholm, since, as a so-called 'inland town', Kokkola was not allowed to engage in foreign trade.
Largely owing to its active vicar and deputy Anders Chydenius, in 1765, Kokkola was awarded a staple right, or the right to conduct foreign trade freely.
Kokkola prospered quickly at the beginning of the 19th century thanks to the tar trade and shipping businesses.
Members of the town's bourgeoisie purchased tar from the peasants, exporting it to foreign lands, often to the ports of the Mediterranean and England.
At times, the merchant navy of Kokkola was the largest in Finland.
The rapid economic development stopped in the middle of the 19th century, only to bloom again in the late 1800s, spurred on by industrialisation.
Kokkola evolved into an important industrial city, thanks in no small part to its leather and metal industry.

The Vantaa region has been inhabited for a very long time.
Remnants of habitation have been found that date back as far as 7,000 years.
The current Vantaa came into being in the area of the former Helsinge Parish.

The Helsinge Parish initially became the Rural Municipality of Helsinki, then the Borough of Vantaa in 1972 and finally the City of Vantaa in 1974.
Vantaa’s position as a neighbour to Helsinki, the capital of Finland, has been an important factor in terms of its development.

Large manors were built in Espoo, which had great significance in terms of the development of the city.
When Finland was annexed to Russia, Helsinki became the capital in 1812.

In 1950, Espoo had 25,000 residents; 15 years later the population had risen to 65,000.
