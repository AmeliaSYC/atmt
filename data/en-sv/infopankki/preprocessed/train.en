information about KokkolaFinnish _ Swedish _ English
history
Kokkola has been the location of a port , a shipyard and a centre of trade since the Middle Ages .
the rising of the land has been a key factor in the history of Kokkola .
it has shaped the environment significantly and affected the development of the port and commerce , for example .
Trading took place along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia , and farming , hunting , fishing and seal hunting were also important sources of livelihood .
the tar export business , later to become crucial to the history of Kokkola , began as early as in the 16th century .
on 7th September 1620 , the Swedish king Gustav Adolf II signed a document transforming the small Ristiranta village , known for fishing and farming , into a town .
at the time , the current Kaupunginsalmi narrow was a slender bay that extended as far as the Kirkonmäki hill .
little by little , Kokkola developed into an important location for shipping and ship building .
there were shipyards in Kaustarinlahti , Mustakari and Soldatskär , for example .
at first , ship routes only covered Turku and Stockholm , since , as a so @-@ called &apos; inland town &apos; , Kokkola was not allowed to engage in foreign trade .
Largely owing to its active vicar and deputy Anders Chydenius , in 1765 , Kokkola was awarded a staple right , or the right to conduct foreign trade freely .
Kokkola prospered quickly at the beginning of the 19th century thanks to the tar trade and shipping businesses .
members of the town &apos;s bourgeoisie purchased tar from the peasants , exporting it to foreign lands , often to the ports of the Mediterranean and England .
at times , the merchant navy of Kokkola was the largest in Finland .
the rapid economic development stopped in the middle of the 19th century , only to bloom again in the late 1800s , spurred on by industrialisation .
Kokkola evolved into an important industrial city , thanks in no small part to its leather and metal industry .

municipalities involved in the cooperation agreement
cooperation agreement of InfoFinland
the funders of InfoFinland have signed a cooperation agreement on the implementation and funding principles of the InfoFinland ( formely Infopankki ) online service for 2017 @-@ 2020 .
such cooperation enables national online communications directed at immigrants and those planning to move to Finland , as well as authorities in the field of immigration , in such a way that it also supports the communication needs of municipalities .
Essential information related to integration and living in Finland is easily and reliably available in a single location , www.infofinland.fi .
the agreement partners maintain and develop the service together .
they also wish to strengthen the national status of InfoFinland so that new municipalities and other communities can join the service in the future .
each municipality &apos;s share of the funding depends on its number of residents .
the implementation of the agreement is monitored by a steering group .
new operators are welcome to develop multilingual communication for immigrants and to join the InfoFinland cooperation agreement .
further information related to joining is provided by InfoFinland &apos;s Chief Editor Eija Kyllönen @-@ Saarnio , eija.kyllonen @-@ saarnio ( at ) hel.fi , tel . 050.363.3285 .
