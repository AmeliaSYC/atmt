so all Israel were reckoned by genealogies ; and behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel : and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience .
now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel , the priests , the Levites , and the Nethinim .

the porters : Shallum , and Akkub , and Talmon , and Ahiman , and their brothers ( Shallum was the chief ) ,
who previously served in the king &apos;s gate eastward : they were the porters for the camp of the children of Levi .
Shallum the son of Kore , the son of Ebiasaph , the son of Korah , and his brothers , of his father &apos;s house , the Korahites , were over the work of the service , keepers of the thresholds of the tent : and their fathers had been over the camp of Yahweh , keepers of the entry .
Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past , and Yahweh was with him .
Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the Tent of Meeting .
all these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve . these were reckoned by genealogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust .
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh , even the house of the tent , by wards .
on the four sides were the porters , toward the east , west , north , and south .
their brothers , in their villages , were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them :
for the four chief porters , who were Levites , were in an office of trust , and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in God &apos;s house .
they lodged around God &apos;s house , because that duty was on them ; and to them pertained its opening morning by morning .
certain of them were in charge of the vessels of service ; for by count were these brought in and by count were these taken out .
some of them also were appointed over the furniture , and over all the vessels of the sanctuary , and over the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices .
some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection of the spices .
Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the office of trust over the things that were baked in pans .
some of their brothers , of the sons of the Kohathites , were over the show bread , to prepare it every Sabbath .
these are the singers , heads of fathers &apos; households of the Levites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
these were heads of fathers &apos; households of the Levites , throughout their generations , chief men : these lived at Jerusalem .
in Gibeon there lived the father of Gibeon , Jeiel , whose wife &apos;s name was Maacah :
and his firstborn son Abdon , and Zur , and Kish , and Baal , and Ner , and Nadab ,
and Gedor , and Ahio , and Zechariah , and Mikloth .
Mikloth became the father of Shimeam . they also lived with their brothers in Jerusalem , over against their brothers .
Ner became the father of Kish ; and Kish became the father of Saul ; and Saul became the father of Jonathan , and Malchishua , and Abinadab , and Eshbaal .
the son of Jonathan was Merib Baal ; and Merib Baal became the father of Micah .
the sons of Micah : Pithon , and Melech , and Tahrea , and Ahaz .
Ahaz became the father of Jarah ; and Jarah became the father of Alemeth , and Azmaveth , and Zimri ; and Zimri became the father of Moza ;
and Moza became the father of Binea ; and Rephaiah his son , Eleasah his son , Azel his son .
Azel had six sons , whose names are these : Azrikam , Bocheru , and Ishmael , and Sheariah , and Obadiah , and Hanan : these were the sons of Azel .
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa .
the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul .
the battle went hard against Saul , and the archers overtook him ; and he was distressed by reason of the archers .
then Saul said to his armor bearer , &quot; Draw your sword , and thrust me through with it , lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me . &quot; but his armor bearer would not ; for he was terrified . therefore Saul took his sword , and fell on it .
when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead , he likewise fell on his sword , and died .
so Saul died , and his three sons ; and all his house died together .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
they stripped him , and took his head , and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people .
they put his armor in the house of their gods , and fastened his head in the house of Dagon .
when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul ,
all the valiant men arose , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
so Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh , because of the word of Yahweh , which he didn &apos;t keep ; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inquire ,
and didn &apos;t inquire of Yahweh : therefore he killed him , and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse .
then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron , saying , &quot; Behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
in times past , even when Saul was king , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh your God said to you , &apos; You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over my people Israel . &apos; &quot;
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh ; and they anointed David king over Israel , according to the word of Yahweh by Samuel .
David and all Israel went to Jerusalem ( the same is Jebus ) ; and the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land , were there .
the inhabitants of Jebus said to David , &quot; You shall not come in here . &quot; nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion . the same is the city of David .
David said , &quot; Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain . &quot; Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first , and was made chief .
David lived in the stronghold ; therefore they called it the city of David .
he built the city all around , from Millo even around ; and Joab repaired the rest of the city .
David grew greater and greater ; for Yahweh of Armies was with him .
now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel .
this is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam , the son of a Hachmonite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time .
after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo , the Ahohite , who was one of the three mighty men .
he was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
they stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
David was then in the stronghold , and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem .
David longed , and said , &quot; Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! &quot;
the three broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to Yahweh ,
and said , &quot; My God forbid it me , that I should do this ! shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy ? &quot; for they risked their lives to bring it . therefore he would not drink it . the three mighty men did these things .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honorable than the two , and was made their captain : however he didn &apos;t attain to the three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a man of great stature , five cubits high ; and in the Egyptian &apos;s hand was a spear like a weaver &apos;s beam ; and he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian &apos;s hand , and killed him with his own spear .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things , and had a name among the three mighty men .
behold , he was more honorable than the thirty , but he didn &apos;t attain to the three : and David set him over his guard .
also the mighty men of the armies : Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
Shammoth the Harorite , Helez the Pelonite ,
Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite , Abiezer the Anathothite ,
Sibbecai the Hushathite , Ilai the Ahohite ,

Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin , Benaiah the Pirathonite ,

Eliel the Mahavite , and Jeribai , and Joshaviah , the sons of Elnaam , and Ithmah the Moabite ,
Eliel , and Obed , and Jaasiel the Mezobaite .
now these are those who came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish ; and they were among the mighty men , his helpers in war .
they were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow : they were of Saul &apos;s brothers of Benjamin .
the chief was Ahiezer ; then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite , and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth , and Beracah , and Jehu the Anathothite ,
and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty , and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Jozabad the Gederathite ,

Elkanah , and Isshiah , and Azarel , and Joezer , and Jashobeam , the Korahites ,
and Joelah , and Zebadiah , the sons of Jeroham of Gedor .
of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness , mighty men of valor , men trained for war , that could handle shield and spear ; whose faces were like the faces of lions , and they were as swift as the roes on the mountains ;
Ezer the chief , Obadiah the second , Eliab the third ,
Mishmannah the fourth , Jeremiah the fifth ,
Attai the sixth , Eliel the seventh ,
Johanan the eighth , Elzabad the ninth ,
Jeremiah the tenth , Machbannai the eleventh .
these of the sons of Gad were captains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David .
David went out to meet them , and answered them , &quot; If you have come peaceably to me to help me , my heart shall be knit to you ; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries , since there is no wrong in my hands , may the God of our fathers look thereon , and rebuke it . &quot;
then the Spirit came on Amasai , who was chief of the thirty , and he said , &quot; We are yours , David , and on your side , you son of Jesse : peace , peace be to you , and peace be to your helpers ; for your God helps you . &quot; then David received them , and made them captains of the band .
of Manasseh also there fell away some to David , when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle ; but they didn &apos;t help them ; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation , saying , &quot; He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads . &quot;
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zillethai , captains of thousands who were of Manasseh .
they helped David against the band of rovers : for they were all mighty men of valor , and were captains in the army .
for from day to day men came to David to help him , until there was a great army , like the army of God .
these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of Yahweh .
the children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , armed for war .
of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valor for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred .
Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron ; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ,
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and of his father &apos;s house twenty @-@ two captains .
of the children of Benjamin , the brothers of Saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul .
of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred , mighty men of valor , famous men in their fathers &apos; houses .
of the half @-@ tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand , who were mentioned by name , to come and make David king .
of the children of Issachar , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their commandment .

all these being men of war , who could order the battle array , came with a perfect heart to Hebron , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
they were there with David three days , eating and drinking ; for their brothers had made preparation for them .
moreover those who were near to them , as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali , brought bread on donkeys , and on camels , and on mules , and on oxen , food of meal , cakes of figs , and clusters of raisins , and wine , and oil , and cattle , and sheep in abundance : for there was joy in Israel .
David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds , even with every leader .
David said to all the assembly of Israel , &quot; If it seems good to you , and if it is of Yahweh our God , let us send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel , with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs , that they may gather themselves to us ;
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us . for we didn &apos;t seek it in the days of Saul . &quot;
all the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
so David assembled all Israel together , from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath , to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim .
David went up , and all Israel , to Baalah , that is , to Kiriath Jearim , which belonged to Judah , to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits above the cherubim , that is called by the Name .
they carried the ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart .
David and all Israel played before God with all their might , even with songs , and with harps , and with stringed instruments , and with tambourines , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark ; for the oxen stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the ark ; and there he died before God .
David was displeased , because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza ; and he called that place Perez Uzza , to this day .
David was afraid of God that day , saying , &quot; How shall I bring the ark of God home to me ? &quot;
so David didn &apos;t move the ark to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
the ark of God remained with the family of Obed @-@ Edom in his house three months : and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed @-@ Edom , and all that he had .
Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and cedar trees , and masons , and carpenters , to build him a house .
David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel ; for his kingdom was exalted on high , for his people Israel &apos;s sake .
David took more wives at Jerusalem ; and David became the father of more sons and daughters .
these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
and Ibhar , and Elishua , and Elpelet ,
and Nogah , and Nepheg , and Japhia ,
and Elishama , and Beeliada , and Eliphelet .
when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David : and David heard of it , and went out against them .
now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim .
David inquired of God , saying , &quot; Shall I go up against the Philistines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? &quot; Yahweh said to him , &quot; Go up ; for I will deliver them into your hand . &quot;
so they came up to Baal Perazim , and David struck them there ; and David said , God has broken my enemies by my hand , like the breach of waters . therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim .
they left their gods there ; and David gave commandment , and they were burned with fire .
the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley .
David inquired again of God ; and God said to him , &quot; You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mulberry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . &quot;
David did as God commanded him : and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer .
the fame of David went out into all lands ; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations .
David made him houses in the city of David ; and he prepared a place for the ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
then David said , &quot; No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites . for Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God , and to minister to him forever . &quot;
David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem , to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place , which he had prepared for it .
David gathered together the sons of Aaron , and the Levites :
of the sons of Kohath , Uriel the chief , and his brothers one hundred twenty ;
of the sons of Merari , Asaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred twenty ;
of the sons of Gershom , Joel the chief , and his brothers one hundred thirty ;
of the sons of Elizaphan , Shemaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred ;
of the sons of Hebron , Eliel the chief , and his brothers eighty ;
of the sons of Uzziel , Amminadab the chief , and his brothers one hundred twelve .
David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests , and for the Levites , for Uriel , Asaiah , and Joel , Shemaiah , and Eliel , and Amminadab ,
and said to them , &quot; You are the heads of the fathers &apos; households of the Levites . sanctify yourselves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel , to the place that I have prepared for it .
for because you didn &apos;t carry it at first , Yahweh our God made broke out against us , because we didn &apos;t seek him according to the ordinance . &quot;
so the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel .
the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh .
David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , stringed instruments and harps and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
and with them their brothers of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , the doorkeepers .
so the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud ;
and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with stringed instruments set to Alamoth ;
and Mattithiah , and Eliphelehu , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight @-@ stringed lyre , to lead .
Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was over the song : he instructed about the song , because he was skillful .
Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark .
Shebaniah , and Joshaphat , and Nethanel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , blew the trumpets before the ark of God : and Obed @-@ Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed @-@ Edom with joy .
it happened , when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams .
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites who bore the ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ephod of linen .
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps .
it happened , as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
they brought in the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins .
he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh , and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh , the God of Israel :
Asaph the chief , and second to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ Edom , and Jeiel , with stringed instruments and with harps ; and Asaph with cymbals , sounding aloud ;
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually , before the ark of the covenant of God .
then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh , by the hand of Asaph and his brothers .
Oh give thanks to Yahweh . call on his name . make his doings known among the peoples .
sing to him . sing praises to him . tell of all his marvelous works .
glory in his holy name . let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice .
seek Yahweh and his strength . seek his face forever more .
remember his marvelous works that he has done , his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth ,
you seed of Israel his servant , you children of Jacob , his chosen ones .
he is Yahweh our God . his judgments are in all the earth .
remember his covenant forever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations ,
the covenant which he made with Abraham , his oath to Isaac .
he confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant ,
saying , &quot; I will give you the land of Canaan , The lot of your inheritance , &quot;
when you were but a few men in number , yes , very few , and foreigners were in it .
they went about from nation to nation , from one kingdom to another people .
he allowed no man to do them wrong . Yes , he reproved kings for their sakes ,
&quot; don &apos;t touch my anointed ones ! do my prophets no harm ! &quot;
sing to Yahweh , all the earth ! Display his salvation from day to day .
declare his glory among the nations , and his marvelous works among all the peoples .
for great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised . he also is to be feared above all gods .
for all the gods of the peoples are idols , but Yahweh made the heavens .
honor and majesty are before him . strength and gladness are in his place .
Ascribe to Yahweh , you relatives of the peoples , ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength !
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . bring an offering , and come before him . worship Yahweh in holy array .
tremble before him , all the earth . the world also is established that it can &apos;t be moved .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice ! let them say among the nations , &quot; Yahweh reigns ! &quot;
let the sea roar , and its fullness ! let the field exult , and all that is therein !
then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh , for he comes to judge the earth .
Oh give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good , for his loving kindness endures forever .
say , &quot; save us , God of our salvation ! gather us together and deliver us from the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise . &quot;
blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting . all the people said , &quot; Amen , &quot; and praised Yahweh .
so he left there , before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , Asaph and his brothers , to minister before the ark continually , as every day &apos;s work required ;
and Obed @-@ Edom with their brothers , sixty @-@ eight ; Obed @-@ Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers ;
and Zadok the priest , and his brothers the priests , before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh , which he commanded to Israel ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate .
all the people departed every man to his house : and David returned to bless his house .
it happened , when David lived in his house , that David said to Nathan the prophet , &quot; Behold , I dwell in a house of cedar , but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under curtains . &quot;
Nathan said to David , &quot; Do all that is in your heart ; for God is with you . &quot;
it happened the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying ,
&quot; go and tell David my servant , &apos; Thus says Yahweh , &quot; You shall not build me a house to dwell in ;
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
in all places in which I have walked with all Israel , did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel , whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people , saying , &apos; Why have you not built me a house of cedar ? &apos; &quot; &apos;
&quot; now therefore , you shall tell my servant David , &apos; Thus says Yahweh of Armies , &quot; I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , that you should be prince over my people Israel .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
I will appoint a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in their own place , and be moved no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more , as at the first ,
and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel ; and I will subdue all your enemies . moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
he shall build me a house , and I will establish his throne forever .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever . his throne shall be established forever . &quot; &apos; &quot;
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so Nathan spoke to David .
then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , &quot; Who am I , Yahweh God , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant &apos;s house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yahweh God .
what can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? for you know your servant .
Yahweh , for your servant &apos;s sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
Yahweh , there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel , whom God went to redeem to himself for a people , to make you a name by great and awesome things , in driving out nations from before your people , whom you redeem out of Egypt ?
for your people Israel you made your own people forever ; and you , Yahweh , became their God .
now , Yahweh , let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant , and concerning his house , be established forever , and do as you have spoken .
let your name be established and magnified forever , saying , &apos; Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel , even a God to Israel . the house of David your servant is established before you . &apos;
for you , my God , have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house . therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you .
now , Yahweh , you are God , and have promised this good thing to your servant .
now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant , that it may continue forever before you ; for you , Yahweh , have blessed , and it is blessed forever . &quot;
after this it happened , that David struck the Philistines , and subdued them , and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines .
he struck Moab ; and the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath , as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates .
David took from him one thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred chariots .
when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck of the Syrians twenty @-@ two thousand men .
then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought tribute . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
from Tibhath and from Cun , cities of Hadadezer , David took very much brass , with which Solomon made the bronze sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah ,
he sent Hadoram his son to king David , to Greet him , and to bless him , because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him ; ( for Hadadezer had wars with Tou ; ) and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass .
king David also dedicated these to Yahweh , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand .
he put garrisons in Edom ; and all the Edomites became servants to David . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went .
David reigned over all Israel ; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people .
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king .
it happened after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his place .
David said , &quot; I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash , because his father showed kindness to me . &quot; so David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father . David &apos;s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun , to comfort him .
but the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun , &quot; Do you think that David honors your father , in that he has sent comforters to you ? haven &apos;t his servants come to you to search , to overthrow , and to spy out the land ? &quot;
so Hanun took David &apos;s servants , and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
then there went certain persons , and told David how the men were served . he sent to meet them ; for the men were greatly ashamed . the king said , &quot; Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return . &quot;
when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and out of Arammaacah , and out of Zobah .
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the army of the mighty men .
the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the gate of the city : and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
he said , &quot; If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God . may Yahweh do that which seems good to him . &quot;
so Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle ; and they fled before him .
when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and killed Shophach the captain of the army .
it happened , at the time of the return of the year , at the time when kings go out , that Joab led forth the army , and wasted the country of the children of Ammon , and came and besieged Rabbah . but David stayed at Jerusalem . Joab struck Rabbah , and overthrew it .
David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set on David &apos;s head : and he brought forth the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
he brought forth the people who were therein , and cut them with saws , and with iron picks , and with axes . David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon . David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines : then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
there was again war with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver &apos;s beam .
there was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were twenty @-@ four , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant .
when he defied Israel , Jonathan the son of Shimea David &apos;s brother killed him .
these were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
Satan stood up against Israel , and moved David to number Israel .
David said to Joab and to the princes of the people , &quot; Go , number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan ; and bring me word , that I may know the sum of them . &quot;
Joab said , &quot; May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are . but , my lord the king , aren &apos;t they all my lord &apos;s servants ? Why does my lord require this thing ? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel ? &quot;
nevertheless the king &apos;s word prevailed against Joab . therefore Joab departed , and went throughout all Israel , and came to Jerusalem .
Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
but he didn &apos;t count Levi and Benjamin among them ; for the king &apos;s word was abominable to Joab .
God was displeased with this thing ; therefore he struck Israel .
David said to God , &quot; I have sinned greatly , in that I have done this thing . but now , put away , I beg you , the iniquity of your servant ; for I have done very foolishly . &quot;
Yahweh spoke to Gad , David &apos;s seer , saying ,
&quot; go and speak to David , saying , &apos; Thus says Yahweh , &quot; I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . &quot; &apos; &quot;
so Gad came to David , and said to him , &quot; Thus says Yahweh , &apos; Take your choice :
either three years of famine ; or three months to be consumed before your foes , while the sword of your enemies overtakes you ; or else three days the sword of Yahweh , even pestilence in the land , and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel . now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me . &apos; &quot;
David said to Gad , &quot; I am in distress . let me fall , I pray , into the hand of Yahweh ; for his mercies are very great . let me not fall into the hand of man . &quot;
so Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel ; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell .
God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it . as he was about to destroy , Yahweh saw , and he relented of the disaster , and said to the destroying angel , &quot; It is enough ; now stay your hand . &quot; the angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders , clothed in sackcloth , fell on their faces .
David said to God , &quot; Isn &apos;t it I who commanded the people to be numbered ? it is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly ; but these sheep , what have they done ? please let your hand , O Yahweh my God , be against me , and against my father &apos;s house ; but not against your people , that they should be plagued . &quot;
then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
David went up at the saying of Gad , which he spoke in the name of Yahweh .
Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . now Ornan was threshing wheat .
as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
then David said to Ornan , &quot; Give me the place of this threshing floor , that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh . you shall sell it to me for the full price , that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people . &quot;
Ornan said to David , &quot; Take it for yourself , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes . behold , I give the oxen for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meal offering . I give it all . &quot;
king David said to Ornan , &quot; No ; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price . for I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh , nor offer a burnt offering without cost . &quot;
so David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place .
David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
Yahweh commanded the angel ; and he put up his sword again into its sheath .
at that time , when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
for the tabernacle of Yahweh , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
but David couldn &apos;t go before it to inquire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh .
then David said , &quot; This is the house of Yahweh God , and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel . &quot;
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God &apos;s house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
and cedar trees without number : for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David .
David said , &quot; Solomon my son is young and tender , and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent , of fame and of glory throughout all countries . I will therefore make preparation for it . &quot; so David prepared abundantly before his death .
then he called for Solomon his son , and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh , the God of Israel .
David said to Solomon his son , &quot; As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God .
but the word of Yahweh came to me , saying , &apos; You have shed blood abundantly , and have made great wars . you shall not build a house to my name , because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight .
behold , a son shall be born to you , who shall be a man of rest . I will give him rest from all his enemies all around ; for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days .
he shall build a house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever . &apos;
now , my son , may Yahweh be with you and prosper you , and build the house of Yahweh your God , as he has spoken concerning you .
may Yahweh give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . don &apos;t be afraid , neither be dismayed .
now , behold , in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold , one million talents of silver , and brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance . I have also prepared timber and stone ; and you may add to them .
there are also workmen with you in abundance , cutters and workers of stone and timber , and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work :
of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . arise and be doing , and may Yahweh be with you . &quot;
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying ,
&quot; isn &apos;t Yahweh your God with you ? hasn &apos;t he given you rest on every side ? for he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand ; and the land is subdued before Yahweh , and before his people .
now set your heart and your soul to seek after Yahweh your God . arise therefore , and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God , to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh , and the holy vessels of God , into the house that is to be built to the name of Yahweh . &quot;
now David was old and full of days ; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
he gathered together all the princes of Israel , with the priests and the Levites .
the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty @-@ eight thousand .
David said , &quot; Of these , twenty @-@ four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh ; six thousand were officers and judges ;
four thousand were doorkeepers ; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made , for giving praise . &quot;
David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
of the Gershonites : Ladan and Shimei .
the sons of Ladan : Jehiel the chief , and Zetham , and Joel , three .
the sons of Shimei : Shelomoth , and Haziel , and Haran , three . these were the heads of the fathers &apos; households of Ladan .
the sons of Shimei : Jahath , Zina , and Jeush , and Beriah . these four were the sons of Shimei .
Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah didn &apos;t have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers &apos; house in one reckoning .
the sons of Kohath : Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel , four .
the sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons , forever , to burn incense before Yahweh , to minister to him , and to bless in his name , forever .
but as for Moses the man of God , his sons were named among the tribe of Levi .
the sons of Moses : Gershom and Eliezer .
