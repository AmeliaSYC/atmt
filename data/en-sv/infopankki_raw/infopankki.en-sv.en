Information about KokkolaFinnish _ Swedish _ English
History
Kokkola has been the location of a port, a shipyard and a centre of trade since the Middle Ages.
The rising of the land has been a key factor in the history of Kokkola.
It has shaped the environment significantly and affected the development of the port and commerce, for example.
Trading took place along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and farming, hunting, fishing and seal hunting were also important sources of livelihood.
The tar export business, later to become crucial to the history of Kokkola, began as early as in the 16th century.
On 7th September 1620, the Swedish king Gustav Adolf II signed a document transforming the small Ristiranta village, known for fishing and farming, into a town.
At the time, the current Kaupunginsalmi narrow was a slender bay that extended as far as the Kirkonmäki hill.
Little by little, Kokkola developed into an important location for shipping and ship building.
There were shipyards in Kaustarinlahti, Mustakari and Soldatskär, for example.
At first, ship routes only covered Turku and Stockholm, since, as a so-called 'inland town', Kokkola was not allowed to engage in foreign trade.
Largely owing to its active vicar and deputy Anders Chydenius, in 1765, Kokkola was awarded a staple right, or the right to conduct foreign trade freely.
Kokkola prospered quickly at the beginning of the 19th century thanks to the tar trade and shipping businesses.
Members of the town's bourgeoisie purchased tar from the peasants, exporting it to foreign lands, often to the ports of the Mediterranean and England.
At times, the merchant navy of Kokkola was the largest in Finland.
The rapid economic development stopped in the middle of the 19th century, only to bloom again in the late 1800s, spurred on by industrialisation.
Kokkola evolved into an important industrial city, thanks in no small part to its leather and metal industry.

The Vantaa region has been inhabited for a very long time.
Remnants of habitation have been found that date back as far as 7,000 years.

Large manors were built in Espoo, which had great significance in terms of the development of the city.

In 1950, Espoo had 25,000 residents; 15 years later the population had risen to 65,000.

History of Helsinki
Gustav I of Sweden founded Helsinki on the banks of the current Vanhankaupunginkoski Rapids by ordering residents of other towns to move there on 12 June 1550.
At the time, Finland belonged to Sweden.
Gustav I wanted to make Helsinki into a trade town to compete with Tallinn, which is why Dutch and German merchants, too, moved there.
Soon, Sweden took Tallinn and Helsinki became a war town, whose port was used to ship soldiers first to the Baltic area and, in the 1630s, to Germany to fight in the Thirty Years’ War.
In 1640, Helsinki was moved to its current location in Vironniemi.
For its first two centuries, Helsinki was a small town.
During the Great Northern War in 1710, the plague killed two-thirds of the population of Helsinki.
Russia occupied Helsinki twice in the 18th century when Sweden and Russian were at war.
In 1748, the construction of the Viapori sea fortress (Sveaborg in Swedish, “The Castle of Sweden), which is currently known as Suomenlinna, began on the islands just off the coast of Helsinki.
The building of the fortress brought more people to the small town and invigorated commerce.
Sweden lost the eastern part of the country to Russia in the war fought between 1808 and 1809.
Russia made the conquered area into the sovereign Grand Duchy of Finland.
In 1812, Emperor Alexander I elevated Helsinki to the status of the capital of Finland.
At the same time, the construction of Helsinki’s Empire style city centre commenced, and the new buildings were to hold the most important institutions of the new Grand Duchy.
The university was also moved from Turku to Helsinki in 1828.
When Finland gained its independence in 1917, Helsinki became the capital of the republic.
In January 1918, the Red Guard, which represented the working population, seized power in Helsinki.
At the same time, the White Guard, which represented the wealthy middle class and the peasants, began to organise in Ostrobothnia, and a civil war erupted.
In April, the German troops that had arrived in Finland took Helsinki for the Whites.
During World War II between 1939 and 1944, the Soviet Union bombed Helsinki, but the city sustained only minor damage thanks to good air defences.
In 1946, new areas were annexed to Helsinki, and the city area grew to nearly eight times its former size.
The population of the city increased rapidly and many new suburbs were constructed in the annexed areas between the 1950s and the 1980s.
Helsinki Day is celebrated annually on the city’s founding day of 12 June.
A variety of events take place on that day throughout Helsinki.

People arrive in Finland
Approximately 10,000 years ago, people began to move to Finland.
They came from the east from current Russia and from the south through the Baltic region.
The roots of the Finnish language are in Central Russia, but the language has elements of Baltic and Germanic languages, too.
Swedish-speaking people have lived in Finland for over 800 years.
Finland as part of Sweden and Russia
Finland was a part of Sweden for over 600 years from the Middle Ages until the early 19th century.
During this time, Sweden and Russia fought frequently over their influence in Finland.
Finland belonged to Russia from 1809 to 1917.
During this period, Finland was autonomous, which meant that Finns could decide on many matters independently.
However, the ruler of Finland was the Emperor of Russia.
The language, culture and economy of Finland developed greatly during the period under Russian rule.
However, in the early 20th century, Russia began to restrict Finnish autonomy, which the Finns did not accept.
Finland gains independence
This made Finland an independent country, and the day is still celebrated as Finnish Independence Day.
In the spring of 1918, a civil war broke out in Finland in which the Reds representing the working people and the Whites representing the bourgeoisie and landowners fought one another.
The war ended in May 1918 with the Whites gaining victory over the Reds.
The independent Finland became a republic where laws are passed by a parliament elected by the people.
The head of state is the president, instead of an emperor or king.
Winter War and Continuation War
At the end of November in 1939, the Soviet army attacked Finland.
During World War II, Finland fought two wars against the Soviet Union: first the Winter War from 1939 to 1940, followed by the Continuation War from 1941 to 1944.
The wars caused Finland to lose areas to the Soviet Union.
Over 400,000 Finns left the lost areas as refugees to escape to the Finland that still remained.
However, the most important thing to the Finns was that Finland maintained its independence.
After the wars, many Finns feared that the Soviet Union would attempt to make Finland a socialist nation, as this had happened to other European neighbours of the Soviet Union.
However, Finland succeeded in forging good relations with the Soviet Union, maintaining its democratic system and increasing trade with Western countries.
In terms of foreign policy, Finland was forced to balance between the Soviet Union and the West for a long time.
With this industrialisation, Finns could sell more and more industrial products abroad.
Finland especially exported paper and other forestry products.
Many things in Finnish society changed.
Plenty of people moved from the countryside to cities, and an increasing number of women began to work outside the home.
The development of public services began, which led to public health care, social welfare and comprehensive school.
In the 1960s, hundreds of thousands of Finns moved to Sweden as there was more work there and the pay was better.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Finland plunged into recesssion as the trade with the Soviets ceased.
At the time, numerous companies went bankrupt, which led to many people losing their jobs.
After the recession, plenty of high-technology industry and related jobs were created in Finland.
More and more people were also working in various service sector professions.
In the 1990s, an increasing number of people began to move to Finland from other countries.
Refugees arrived in Finland from many countries, along with people from the former Soviet Union who had a Finnish background.
Many also moved to Finland for studies, employment or family reasons.
In 1995, Finland became a member of the European Union (EU).
In 2002, Finland adopted the common EU currency, the euro, among the first EU countries, thereby relinquishing its own currency.

Creating Finnish welfare: a century of Finland and the Virtanen family
Finnish history is a story of trading routes, clashes of cultures and life next to great neighbours.
Finnish prehistory to 1323
People have lived in the region of Finland since the Ice Age, circa 8800 BCE.
Habitation first settled along water routes, and since then busy trading traffic has always passed through the region.
The name of Finland’s oldest city, Turku, means ‘place of trade’.
The first written sources that mention Finland date back to the 12th and 13th centuries.
Around that time, crusades brought Finland into the sphere of power of the Roman Pope and the medieval network of Hansa traders.
The Catholic Church spread to the region of Finland from Sweden, while the Orthodox Church did the same from Novgorod, currently Russia, in the East.
The struggle for control of the region between Sweden and Novgorod ended with the Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323.
With the treaty, the Catholic faith was established in western Finland and the Orthodox faith in eastern Finland.
This religious boundary still exists, although the Reformation replaced Catholicism with Lutheranism.
Easternmost part of Sweden 1323–1809
After the Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323, most of Finland was a part of Sweden.
For about 500 years, Finnish history is Swedish history.
The region of Finland was Sweden’s buffer against the East, and the borders shifted many times in various wars.
Finns consider themselves Western Europeans because the time as a part of the Kingdom of Sweden strongly tied Finns to the Western cultural heritage.
For example, Finns fought in the Thirty Years’ War with Swedish troops in Central Europe.
At the same time, however, there were also connections to eastern trade centres and the Orthodox Church.
Important events

1550 Helsinki is founded to compete with Tallinn for Baltic Sea trade
1640
The first university in Finland is established in Turku
Finland as a part of the Russian Empire 1809–1917
Russia captured the region of Finland from Sweden in 1808–1809.
Most of the laws from the time of the Swedish rule remained in force.
During the Russian rule, Finland became a special region developed by order of the Emperor.
For example, Helsinki city centre was built during Russian rule.
Starting from 1899, Russia tightened its grip on the Grand Duchy of Finland.
Finland did not take part in World War I, but nationalism also had an influence on the region of Finland.
Finland was granted its own parliament in 1906, and the first elections were held in 1907.
Finland declared independence on 6 December 1917, and the Bolshevik government that seized power in the October Revolution in Russia recognised Finnish independence on 31 December 1917.
Important events
1812 Helsinki becomes the capital
The old capital Turku is destroyed in a fire, emphasising Helsinki’s standing
1860 Finland adopts its own currency, the markka
1906 Universal and equal right to vote, also for women
Early years of independence 1917–1945
In the early years of independence, Finland’s position was fragile.
Soon after independence, a bloody civil war broke out in Finland.
The war was fought between the Reds or labour movement and the Whites or government troops.
The Whites received support from Germany and the Reds from Russia.
The war ended in the Whites’ victory.
Finland was strongly in the German sphere of influence because the Soviet Union became the biggest threat to the security of the state.
In the 1930s, many right-wing and far-right movements were popular in Finland, as in other parts of Europe.
In August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union agreed that Finland belonged in the Soviet Union’s sphere of influence.
During World War II, Finland fought on two occasions against the Soviet Union on the German side.
Finland lost both wars, but the Soviet Union never occupied Finland.
Because Finland was able to defend its territory in wars soon after gaining independence, Finland’s wars in the 20th century have been considered as a time where the independence of the State of Finland became established.
Important events
1918 Civil War between the Reds and Whites
1921 Act on compulsory education makes it mandatory to attend six years of elementary school
1939–1940 Finland is thrust into World War II when the Winter War breaks out between Finland and the Soviet Union
1941–1944 World War II continues as Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union
Rebuilding, industrialisation and the Cold War 1945–1991
As a defeated party, Finland had to pay the Soviet Union heavy war reparations in the form of goods.
The war reparations included, for example, trains, ships and raw materials.
Finland financed the building of the goods with loans and aid.
The production of the war reparations helped Finland evolve from an agrarian country into an industrialised country.
The industrialisation started a migration from the countryside into the cities.
In 1948, Finland and the Soviet Union signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, where the countries promised to defend each other against external treats.
In practice, Finland was in the Soviet Union’s sphere of influence throughout the Cold War, and the country’s foreign and domestic policy were guided by fear of the Soviet Union.
Important events
1948 Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union
1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki
1968 Finnish comprehensive school institution founded
The collapse of the Soviet Union and loan-based economic growth in the 1980s caused a recession in Finland in the 1990s.
The worst time of the recession was in the early 1990s; many Finnish people were unemployed, companies went bankrupt and the state had little money.
In about 1995, the Finnish economy started to grow, the most important company being mobile phone company Nokia.
Finland joined the EU in 1995 and was one of the first countries to adopt the euro as its currency.

Volunteer work is a good way to help, meet new people and participate in something that is important to you.
Volunteer work is not the same as work or practical training.
Gaining entry to working life
If you have little work experience in Finland or your Finnish skills are inadequate, volunteer work is a good way to gain entry to working life and improve your language skills.
Volunteer work does not pay a salary, but the work experience may prove useful when you apply for paid work.
Directly contact the organisation you would like to volunteer in.
If you receive unemployment benefits, find out from your Employment and Economic Development Office whether volunteer work has an impact on your benefits.
In some cases, volunteer work can be included in your integration plan.
Fun hobby
Volunteer work can also be an excellent hobby.
You can usually decide for yourself when and how often you would like to volunteer.
In volunteer work, you can meet people with whom you share common interests and make new friends.
You may also be able to utilise the contacts you have made during volunteer work later on in your working life.

Compared to the number of citizens, the number of associations in Finland is high.
According to the law, everyone has the right to participate in association activities.
The freedom of association also applies to foreign citizens.
An association can be, for example, a sports club, cultural association, friendship association or a religious association.
Registered associations are non-profit organisations.
An association must not be established to conduct business.
In Finland, there are also many associations founded by immigrants.
An immigrant association or a friendship association in contact with your home country may help you to maintain and develop your native culture in the new society and collaborate with authorities and other organisations.
You can search for different associations at the Finnish Patent and Registration Office’s AssociationNet service.

Founding an Association
In practice, the process of founding an association involves three phases:
Making a decision on the founding of an association
Drafting the rules of the association
Registering the association
Registering an Association
It is worthwhile to register an association.
This makes the association a legal person whose members are not personally liable for its operations.
A registered association may apply for funding and financial assistance and cooperate with other associations and authorities.
An association can be registered by submitting a notice to the Finnish Patent and Registration Office.
linkkiNational Board of Patents and Registration of Finland:
Register of AssociationsFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Founding an Association When the Founders Are Foreigners
Foreigners – i.e. persons without Finnish citizenship – can also establish registered associations.
In this case, the chairman and deputy chairman must both reside in Finland.
If the place of residence of the chairman or deputy chairman is in another country, the association can apply for an exemption from the Finnish Patent and Registration Office.
Activities of an Association
Associations usually operate in one year periods.
They plan their activities and finances one year at a time.
The finances and bookkeeping must be audited at the end of each period.
The members of an association hold all the power.
The most important decisions are made in association meetings that are open to all members.

In Finland, the range of hobby activities available to children and young people is very diverse.
They can engage in sports, dance, music, visual arts or theatre, to name only a few examples.
Some of the activities are subject to a fee, but completely free hobbies are also available.
In addition, municipalities organise guided activities for children and young people.
Children and Sports
Exercise for young children does not necessarily have to be instructed, but normal playing and outdoor activities in different environments are enough.
It is, however, good for young children to engage in as many different kinds of exercise as possible, as this will promote their motoric skills and health.
Day-care centres provide some of the exercise that children need by organising games that feature moving around.
Some sports clubs also organise exercise activities for young children.
Day care centres and schools take part in organising sports activities but it is not their primary function.
A child will not get enough exercise by only participating in the physical education classes.
Therefore, it is a good idea to provide children with the opportunities to engage in a sufficient amount of exercise outside the day care and school environments, as well.
Sports and Exercise
Additional information on sports-related hobbies can be found on the Exercise pages of InfoFinland.
For information on individual sports or on facilities where they can be practiced, contact the association for the sport you are interested in.
Arts
In addition to sports youngsters can engage in a variety of art hobbies, such as visual art, music and theatre.
Related activities are organised by adult education centres, art schools, music schools and municipal youth services, for example.
For information on hobby opportunities, schedules and prices, contact the organising party directly.
Youth Work
Municipal youth services are intended for children and young adults.
The most common services include various clubs and open-to-all activities organised in youth centres.
The services may vary slightly in different parts of the country.
Additional information on youth activities organised by your municipality can be obtained from your local youth services.
Many organisations and parishes also take part in youth work.
A youth centre is a place where young people can spend time and engage in a variety of recreational activities.
Youth centres also organise guided activities.
The youth centre activities are primarily free of charge.
The activities are organised based on the wishes of the young people, who can also influence the content themselves.
There is always an adult – normally a municipal youth worker or youth instructor – present at a youth centre.
The age limits for youth premises vary.
Young People and Social Involvement
Young people have a wide range of opportunities for social involvement.
An easy way to start is to participate in the student body activities of your own school or educational institute, for example.
Taking part in the activities of a student body or organisation is a good way to ensure that the voice of the young people is heard especially when decisions affecting their living environment are being made.
Specialised civic organisations have already been established for promoting numerous social issues.
Many of these organisations and associations have separate youth divisions that organise activities for younger members.
In addition, special organisations for young people, preadolescents and students are available.

There are approximately a thousand museums in Finland, some 300 of which are regularly open to public.
The rest are primarily museums of local culture and history that are open during the summer.
Museums are intended for everyone.
They can be devoted to art, history, nature, a certain individual or a specialty field.
Open-air museums are more expansive museum areas that include entire buildings.
An open-air museum can be, for example, a yard area of a traditional Finnish farm house or some other area that has been made into a museum.
Among well-known Finnish museums of this kind are the Seurasaari Open-Air Museum in Helsinki and the Luostarinmäki Handicrafts Museum in Turku.
Finnish art is exhibited, for example, in Ateneum, which is part of the Finnish National Gallery, and at the Espoo Museum of Modern Art (EMMA).
The Finnish cultural history can be explored in the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki, among other locations.
In addition to this, a large number of museums and museum areas are located all over Finland.
The collections of some museums can even be viewed online.

The Finnish nature is diverse.
Hiking and other recreation in nature is enjoyable and safe when you choose routes that suit your fitness and skill level, and when you observe the necessary guidelines and regulations.
Finland goes through four decidedly different seasons.
Depending on the season and region, you can engage in different types of recreation.
More information about Finnish seasons is available on the InfoFinland page Finnish Climate.
Hiking and trekking
Hiking and trekking are hobbies that are suitable for all seasons.
If you have no prior experience, you should begin with short and easy routes located close to residential areas.
You can embark on short hiking trips without any special equipment.
However, you should bring along something to drink, a phone and a map.
It is advisable to start off with hiking on marked trails.
Hiking and trekking maps are sold in bookshops and online.
Longer hiking trips and treks require more planning and preparation.
Aurora
Finland is one of the best places in the world for spotting northern lights (aurora borealis).
Most often you can see them in the skies of Northern Lapland between September and March.
Sometimes auroras also appear in Southern Finland.
A clear and dark night away from the lights of population centres provides the optimal conditions for sightings.
Remember to dress warmly as the night is often cold.
In summer, the nights are too bright for viewing auroras.
AuroraFinnish _ English
Skiing
Cross-country skiing is one of the most popular winter sports in Finland.
It is a healthy and very inexpensive form of exercise.
Information on skiing lessons, equipment rentals and ski trails is available, for example, on the website of the Finnish Central Association for Recreational Sports and Outdoor Activities, Suomen Latu ry, in Finnish.
Information on cross-country skiingFinnish
Recreation and Travel on Water
Finns travel on water quite frequently.
Paddling and sailing are also popular activities in Finland.
Safety is extremely important when travelling on water.
Pay attention to weather forecasts, and always use a life jacket of the correct size.
Recreation and Travel on Ice
In winter, the majority of the Finnish water areas is covered in ice.
The activities you can engage in on ice include walking, skating, skiing and ice fishing.
Especially thick ice is also strong enough for cars and snowmobiles.
There are always risks involved in travelling or spending time on ice, and safety is an important concern.
Important reminders for safety on ice:
When water freezes into ice, the ice is not sufficiently strong right away.
Ice hardness can vary even within short distances.
In the spring, ice strength is extremely difficult to estimate, which is why it is wise to stay off the ice.
Ice picks are the most important tool to have with you when travelling on ice.
Without them, it is very difficult to get out of the water if you fall through the ice.
If you are not sure about the ice strength, do not go on ice.
Fishing
With a few exceptions, angling and ice fishing are covered by the everyman’s rights, so they do not require a fishing permit.
For other types of fishing and crayfishing, a permit is needed:
The provincial lure fishing fee is personal, and it must be paid before fishing.
The fee can be paid for the entire calendar year or for seven days at a time.
Information on fishing permitsFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Everyman’s rights
Everyman’s rights (jokamiehen oikeudet) are an integral part of Finnish culture and legislation.
Everyman’s rights in brief
You may:
walk, ski or cycle freely in nature, except in yard areas and in such fields, meadows or plantations that could easily be damaged
stay temporarily in areas where roaming is allowed – you can, for example, set up camp relatively freely as long as you maintain a sufficient distance from people’s homes
pick berries, mushrooms and flowers
angle and ice fish
boat, swim or wash yourself in water systems and travel on ice
You may not:
disturb or cause harm to others
disturb or cause damage to birds’ nests or their young
disturb reindeer or game animals
cut down or damage living trees
collect dried or fallen wood, twigs, moss or similar on someone else’s property without permission
light open fires on other people’s property, except in an emergency
disturb the privacy of people’s homes by camping too close or by making too much noise
leave litter
drive motor vehicles off road without the landowner’s permission
fish or hunt without the relevant permits

National Parks and Conservation Areas

A national park is a large conservation area spanning over 1,000 hectares.

The beautiful landscapes of the national parks are excellent travel destinations.
In the largest parks, it is possible to stay overnight and embark on longer treks.

It is a good idea to start your visit there.
The national parks are maintained by Metsähallitus.

However, you should bring along something to drink, a phone and a map.
It is advisable to start off with hiking on marked trails.
Hiking and trekking maps are sold in bookshops and online.
Longer hiking trips and treks require more planning and preparation.
Aurora
Finland is one of the best places in the world for spotting northern lights (aurora borealis).
Most often you can see them in the skies of Northern Lapland between September and March.
Sometimes auroras also appear in Southern Finland.
A clear and dark night away from the lights of population centres provides the optimal conditions for sightings.
Remember to dress warmly as the night is often cold.
In summer, the nights are too bright for viewing auroras.

Skiing
Cross-country skiing is one of the most popular winter sports in Finland.
It is a healthy and very inexpensive form of exercise.
Information on skiing lessons, equipment rentals and ski trails is available, for example, on the website of the Finnish Central Association for Recreational Sports and Outdoor Activities, Suomen Latu ry, in Finnish.

Recreation and Travel on Water
Finns travel on water quite frequently.
Paddling and sailing are also popular activities in Finland.
Safety is extremely important when travelling on water.
Pay attention to weather forecasts, and always use a life jacket of the correct size.
Recreation and Travel on Ice
In winter, the majority of the Finnish water areas is covered in ice.
The activities you can engage in on ice include walking, skating, skiing and ice fishing.
Especially thick ice is also strong enough for cars and snowmobiles.
There are always risks involved in travelling or spending time on ice, and safety is an important concern.
Important reminders for safety on ice:
When water freezes into ice, the ice is not sufficiently strong right away.
Ice hardness can vary even within short distances.
In the spring, ice strength is extremely difficult to estimate, which is why it is wise to stay off the ice.
Ice picks are the most important tool to have with you when travelling on ice.
Without them, it is very difficult to get out of the water if you fall through the ice.
If you are not sure about the ice strength, do not go on ice.
Fishing
With a few exceptions, angling and ice fishing are covered by the everyman’s rights, so they do not require a fishing permit.
For other types of fishing and crayfishing, a permit is needed:
The provincial lure fishing fee is personal, and it must be paid before fishing.
The fee can be paid for the entire calendar year or for seven days at a time.
Information on fishing permitsFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Everyman’s rights
Everyman’s rights (jokamiehen oikeudet) are an integral part of Finnish culture and legislation.
Everyman’s rights in brief
You may:
walk, ski or cycle freely in nature, except in yard areas and in such fields, meadows or plantations that could easily be damaged

National Parks and Conservation Areas
There are 40 national parks in Finland.
A national park is a large conservation area spanning over 1,000 hectares.
The primary function of national parks is to secure natural diversity, but they are also sights accessible to everyone.
The beautiful landscapes of the national parks are excellent travel destinations.
In the largest parks, it is possible to stay overnight and embark on longer treks.
National parks often include nature centres, which are maintained by the state-owned enterprise Metsähallitus and which provide up-to-date information on the local environment and travelling safely in it.
It is a good idea to start your visit there.
The national parks are maintained by Metsähallitus.

Finns are very active when it comes to sports, so related hobbies can help you to meet new people and gain friends.
Guided sports activities are organised by various, often volunteer-based, sports clubs, for example.
Light exercise can be gardening, cleaning or clearing snow – in other words, so-called functional exercise (hyötyliikunta).
Walking or cycling to work or to the grocery shop is an easy way to get your daily dose of exercise.
Exercise is also beneficial to the elderly as it maintains good physical condition and the ability to function.
Exercise is also important for children.
Read more on the Infopankki page Hobbies for children and young people.
Instructed Sports Activities
Municipalities and sports clubs, among others, organise instructed sports activities.
Some municipalities organise instructed sports activities especially aimed at immigrants, such as women-only groups or introduction to various types of sports.
Organised sports are open to all.
Everyone can participate in the activities of sports clubs.
Instructed sports can include activities such as exercise classes, guided walks, jogs or skiing trips.
Selecting a Sport and a Group
When selecting a sports group, bear in mind your own level.
Groups are available for beginners and more advanced enthusiasts.
Swimming and skiing are very popular in Finland, so beginner courses are also held for adults.
After you grasp the basics, both of the above-mentioned sports can be practiced independently and at low cost or even free of charge.
Sports Facilities
Approximately 70 per cent of the sports facilities in Finland are owned by municipalities.
These include, for example, sports arenas, indoor swimming pools and other facilities, such as football fields and skating rinks.
The municipal sports facilities are available to all residents.
For additional information on the municipal facilities, contact the sports department of your municipality.
The contact information can be found on the website of the municipality.
Larger cities also have privately-owned sports facilities.
Information on the available services and pricing can be obtained by contacting the facilities directly.
Students and employed persons should find out whether their school or employer provides opportunities for sports.

In the event of a sudden or unclear death, accident or crime, an autopsy can be conducted to determine the cause of death.
The police can also investigate the cause of death.
Burial may sometimes be delayed as identifying the cause of death may take some time.
Funerals
You can receive help for organising a funeral from religious communities.
For more information, contact your community.
The website of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland contains information on the church’s services.
It is also possible to hold a civil funeral, which does not include religious ceremonies. For more information on civil funerals, contact the Pro-Ceremonies (Pro-Seremoniat) service centres.
The services provided by funeral homes are subject to a fee.
These establishments take care of the funeral arrangements, such as the transport of the deceased.
Funeral homes also sell coffins and, upon agreement, handle all other funeral matters requested by the family.
Information on funeral homes can be obtained, for example, from the Finnish Association of Funeral Homes (Suomen Hautaustoimistojen Liitto).
Many funeral homes also provide their services in English.

Graves
Nearly all Finnish cemeteries are owned by Evangelical Lutheran parishes, but a grave can be obtained even if you do not belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church.
Graves are subject to a charge, and more information is available from the parishes.
If the deceased person did not belong to a church and did not want a religious burial, such a ceremony will not be arranged.
Deceased persons can be buried in coffins or cremated.
Many municipalities also include cemeteries of other religions.
For example, Orthodox, Islamic and Jewish cemeteries are available in the largest cities.
In addition, many municipalities have grave sites for deceased persons who did not belong to any religion.
Cremated ashes can also be sprinkled on land or into a body of water if this is permitted by the land owner.
Funeral allowances
Sometimes the deceased is entitled to funeral allowance (hautausavustus) due to his or her final employment or to membership of a trade union.
To find out more, contact the employer or the trade union.
It is possible to apply for financial assistance with the social office (sosiaalitoimisto) of the place of domicile if the deceased was without financial means.
Family pension (perhe-eläke) can be paid to the spouse or children of the deceased after his or her death.
The purpose of the pension is to ensure the livelihood of the widow and children.
Two family pension schemes are in place in Finland: Kela’s (the Social Insurance institution of Finland) family pension and the employment pension system’s family pension.
If the deceased persons was employed or ran a business in Finland, the widow and children may be eligible for a family pension provided by the employment pension system.
Both pensions can be applied for at Kela.
If a person has lived or worked in another country for an extended period of time before moving to Finland, the spouse or children may also be entitled to receive a family pension from this country.

Wills
The law dictates who inherits the property of a deceased person.
You can also influence to whom your property will be distributed.
You can prepare a will (testamentti), i.e. a written clarification on who will inherit your property after your death.
It is advisable to employ the services of a lawyer when preparing a will in order to ensure its legitimacy.
Estate inventory
Estate inventory (perunkirjoitus) is an event where a written account of the deceased person’s property, belongings and debts is prepared.
The inventory must be held within three months of the death.
Extracts from the population register (virkatodistus), which can be obtained from the local registry or parish office, are also required.
In addition, information is required on the estate beneficiaries, i.e. the persons who will inherit the property of the deceased.
An estate inventory document (perukirja) must be submitted to the tax office no later than one month from the reading of the will.
More information on estate inventory is available from the Judicial System and Tax Administration.
The estate inventory is arranged by the person who is most intimately familiar with the deceased person’s property and debts.
The document is signed by two persons who evaluate the property.
It is advisable to employ a lawyer for the process.
If the estate inventory is not completed in time, detrimental effects, such as raised inheritance tax, may result.
Inheritance tax
If you inherit the property of a deceased person, you are liable to pay inheritance tax (perintövero).
The amount of the tax depends on the amount of the property and how close a relative you are.
Tax does not need to be paid for inheritance totalling less than €20,000.

Divorce and custody of children
Divorce applications can be filed with the district court of your municipality of residence.
You can file for divorce independently or together with your spouse.

Upon the submission of the divorce application to the district court (käräjäoikeus), a six-month reconsideration period begins.
Once this period is over, divorce must be filed for within six months.
The divorce will not become official until the second application has been approved.
If you have children under 18 with your spouse, their situation can be resolved at the same time as applying for the divorce.
It can be agreed upon who will take custody of the children, where they will live and when each parent can see them.
At this time, you can also agree upon maintenance, i.e. financial support, paid by one of the parents for the child/children.
You can settle the issues with your spouse or contact your local social office (sosiaalitoimisto).
If your marriage ends, you may require both mental support and legal aid.
Legal aid can be requested at the Public Legal Aid Office (oikeusaputoimisto).
Mental support can be received, for example, in various support groups intended for divorcees.
These activities are organised by parishes and various organisations, for example.
More information on matters related to the custody of children is available on the InfoFinland pages Divorce, Single parent families and What is a family?.

Divorce and custody of children
Divorce applications can be filed with the district court of your municipality of residence.
You can file for divorce independently or together with your spouse.
Divorce must be applied for twice, i.e. in two phases.
Upon the submission of the divorce application to the district court (käräjäoikeus), a six-month reconsideration period begins.
Once this period is over, divorce must be filed for within six months.
The divorce will not become official until the second application has been approved.
If you have children under 18 with your spouse, their situation can be resolved at the same time as applying for the divorce.
It can be agreed upon who will take custody of the children, where they will live and when each parent can see them.
At this time, you can also agree upon maintenance, i.e. financial support, paid by one of the parents for the child/children.
You can settle the issues with your spouse or contact your local social office (sosiaalitoimisto).
If your marriage ends, you may require both mental support and legal aid.
Legal aid can be requested at the Public Legal Aid Office (oikeusaputoimisto).
Mental support can be received, for example, in various support groups intended for divorcees.

According to Finnish law, everyone is entitled to be treated equally regardless of their background or gender.
Discrimination (syrjintä) is a crime.
What is discrimination?
Discrimination refers to unequal treatment, i.e. treating one person more poorly than another in the same situation.
Discrimination can be based on ethnic group, nationality or religion etc.
Creating a threatening, hostile, disparaging or humiliating atmosphere can also be considered discrimination.
Examples of discrimination include not getting service due to your ethnic origin, or being required to demonstrate perfect proficiency in Finnish at a job interview although the work itself does not require such skills.
Treating people differently is not always discrimination.
People can be treated differently if there are acceptable grounds.
The Non-Discrimination Act defines what is considered discrimination.
The Act prohibits discrimination based on age, origin, nationality, language, religion, belief, opinion, political activity, trade union activity, family circumstances, health, disability, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics.
No one must be put in a less favourable position due to these factors.
The Equality Act prohibits discrimination based on gender.

If you cannot pay your bills
If you are unable to pay a bill, immediately contact its sender.
You can often get an extension for the payment due date of the bill.
In such cases, a small late fee is usually added to the bill.
If you have not paid a bill by its due date and have not agreed on an extension, you have to pay a reminder and collection fee as well as a late fee.
Collection
If you have not paid a bill by its due date, you will receive a reminder bill.
After one or two reminders, the bill may transfer to a collection agency.
The collection agency will send you a demand for payment.
If you are unable to pay the bill immediately, contact the collection agency and arrange a payment plan for the bill.
If you do not pay the bill or arrange a payment plan, the debt may finally go into enforcement (ulosotto).
Enforcement means that the authority will have the right to take some of your income to pay your debt.
The enforcement authority can also sell your valuable possessions in order to pay the debt.
A decision of the district court is often required for enforcement.
However, some payments go into enforcement immediately.
Such payments include taxes, health centre fees and day-care fees, for example.
Non-payment record
If you do not pay a bill or debt, you may get a non-payment record (maksuhäiriömerkintä) in the credit information register.
It causes many difficulties.
Landlords and banks often check your credit information in the register.
If you have a non-payment record, you may not get a rental dwelling, bank loan or credit card.
An employer may also demand that their employee not have any non-payment records.

If you cannot pay your rent
Your lessor is entitled to dissolve your rental agreement if you do not pay your rent.
The lessor must notify the tenant of the dissolution of the rental agreement.
At this point it is usually still possible to reach an agreement with the lessor concerning the payment of due rent.
If you do not pay your rent, your lessor can ask a court for an eviction.
This means that you will have to move out of the apartment and pay the rent you have neglected to pay.
If you are having difficulties paying your rent, contact your lessor.
Ask your lessor to give you more time to make the payment.
You can also ask for advice from your local social welfare office.
Also find out if you are entitled to receive, for example, housing allowance or income support.
You can ask Kela if you are eligible to receive housing allowance and income support.
The InfoFinland web page Housing allowance contains information on housing allowance.
Help with financial problems
Social benefits
Check that you have applied for all the social benefits you are entitled to receive.
They may include, for example, unemployment benefit, housing allowance, student financial aid and financial aid for families with children.
Income support
If your or your family’s income and assets are not enough to cover necessary daily expenses, you can apply for basic income support (perustoimeentulotuki) from Kela.
The necessary daily expenses mean reasonable expenses on, for example, food, clothes, healthcare and housing.
Basic income support also covers expenses on hobbies and recreational activities, children’s day care, morning and afternoon activities for schoolchildren and necessary moving costs.
Your income support is affected by all your income and assets.
This also includes social welfare benefits from, for example, Kela, employment pension insurance or unemployment fund.
Before applying for income support, apply for all the other benefits and allowances that you are entitled to (such as unemployment benefit, housing allowance, pension, study grant, parenthood allowance, sickness allowance, child home care allowance or child maintenance support).
Income support is meant to be a temporary help.
Income support is only paid if you cannot get any other income or benefits or if the other benefits do not cover the necessary expenses.
If you or your family have expenses caused by special needs and you cannot get basic income support for those expenses, your municipality’s social welfare office may grant supplementary and preventive income support (täydentävä ja ehkäisevä toimeentulotuki).
You can get income support, for example, to secure your housing situation or if your financial situation suddenly gets worse.
The purpose of supplementary and preventive income support is to help people manage on their own and prevent social exclusion.
Always apply to Kela for basic income support first.
If you need supplementary or preventive income support, you can mention it in the same application.
If you ask, Kela can transfer your application for supplementary and preventive income support to your municipality.
If you need, you can get advice about applying for income support from Kela, your municipality’s social welfare office or immigrants’ information service point.

If you cannot pay your bills
If you are unable to pay a bill, immediately contact its sender.
You can often get an extension for the payment due date of the bill.
In such cases, a small late fee is usually added to the bill.
If you have not paid a bill by its due date and have not agreed on an extension, you have to pay a reminder and collection fee as well as a late fee.
Collection
If you have not paid a bill by its due date, you will receive a reminder bill.
After one or two reminders, the bill may transfer to a collection agency.
The collection agency will send you a demand for payment.
If you are unable to pay the bill immediately, contact the collection agency and arrange a payment plan for the bill.
If you do not pay the bill or arrange a payment plan, the debt may finally go into enforcement (ulosotto).
Enforcement means that the authority will have the right to take some of your income to pay your debt.
The enforcement authority can also sell your valuable possessions in order to pay the debt.
A decision of the district court is often required for enforcement.
However, some payments go into enforcement immediately.
Such payments include taxes, health centre fees and day-care fees, for example.
Non-payment record
If you do not pay a bill or debt, you may get a non-payment record (maksuhäiriömerkintä) in the credit information register.
It causes many difficulties.
Landlords and banks often check your credit information in the register.
If you have a non-payment record, you may not get a rental dwelling, bank loan or credit card.
An employer may also demand that their employee not have any non-payment records.

If you cannot pay your rent
Your lessor is entitled to dissolve your rental agreement if you do not pay your rent.
The lessor must notify the tenant of the dissolution of the rental agreement.
At this point it is usually still possible to reach an agreement with the lessor concerning the payment of due rent.
If you do not pay your rent, your lessor can ask a court for an eviction.
This means that you will have to move out of the apartment and pay the rent you have neglected to pay.
If you are having difficulties paying your rent, contact your lessor.
Ask your lessor to give you more time to make the payment.
You can also ask for advice from your local social welfare office.
Also find out if you are entitled to receive, for example, housing allowance or income support.
You can ask Kela if you are eligible to receive housing allowance and income support.
The InfoFinland web page Housing allowance contains information on housing allowance.
Help with financial problems
Social benefits
Check that you have applied for all the social benefits you are entitled to receive.
They may include, for example, unemployment benefit, housing allowance, student financial aid and financial aid for families with children.
Income support
If your or your family’s income and assets are not enough to cover necessary daily expenses, you can apply for basic income support (perustoimeentulotuki) from Kela.
The necessary daily expenses mean reasonable expenses on, for example, food, clothes, healthcare and housing.
Basic income support also covers expenses on hobbies and recreational activities, children’s day care, morning and afternoon activities for schoolchildren and necessary moving costs.
Your income support is affected by all your income and assets.
This also includes social welfare benefits from, for example, Kela, employment pension insurance or unemployment fund.
Before applying for income support, apply for all the other benefits and allowances that you are entitled to (such as unemployment benefit, housing allowance, pension, study grant, parenthood allowance, sickness allowance, child home care allowance or child maintenance support).
Income support is meant to be a temporary help.
Income support is only paid if you cannot get any other income or benefits or if the other benefits do not cover the necessary expenses.
If you or your family have expenses caused by special needs and you cannot get basic income support for those expenses, your municipality’s social welfare office may grant supplementary and preventive income support (täydentävä ja ehkäisevä toimeentulotuki).

Cancellation of residence permit
If you move abroad
If your marriage or registered partnership ends
If you lose your job
Cancellation of residence permit
Your permanent or fixed-term residence permit will be cancelled if
you move away from Finland permanently,
you continuously reside abroad for two years.
Your permanent or fixed-term residence permit can also be cancelled if
you provided incorrect information when applying for the permit,
you withheld a factor that could have prevented you from receiving the permit, or
another Schengen country requests Finland to revoke your residence permit.
A fixed-term residence permit can also be revoked if the grounds on which it was granted no longer exist.
The decisions regarding residence permit cancellations are made by the Finnish Immigration Service.
If you move abroad
If you intend to move away from Finland for two years due to, for example, work or studies, you can submit an application to the Finnish Immigration Service to prevent the cancellation of your residence permit.
The application can be free form but must include the date, along with your signature and personal information.
It must also indicate the duration of and reason for your stay abroad.
In addition, it must include justification for why your residence permit should not be cancelled.
You must submit the application before residing abroad for two years.
If your Finnish employer has assigned you to work abroad, you will not lose your residence permit for Finland even if your work forces you to reside abroad for more than two years.
If your marriage or registered partnership ends
If you have a fixed-term residence permit based on family ties, the end of your marriage or registered partnership may affect your residence permit.
If the family tie no longer exists, a residence permit granted on that basis will not necessarily be extended.
It is also possible that your residence permit currently in force will be cancelled.
However, your residence permit can be extended if you continue to have strong ties to Finland.
Examples of such strong ties include:
children or other family members in Finland
a job or a business in Finland
a student position in Finland.
If you divorce your spouse because of his or her violent behaviour towards you, your residence permit can be extended despite the divorce.
You should present a clarifying document, such as a doctor’s certificate or a statement from a family counselling centre.
You should also attach your account of the circumstances to the residence permit application.
More information on divorce and the termination of a registered partnership is available on the InfoFinland page Divorce.
If you lose your job
If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
More information on working and running a business in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Employment and entrepreneurship.
Information on residence permits for employees and entrepreneurs can be found on the pages Work in Finland and Moving to Finland as an entrepreneur.
If you already have a residence permit in Finland but are not granted a residence permit extension, the Finnish Immigration Service makes a deportation decision.
If you commit crimes in Finland, you can also be deported based on the crimes.
If you are deported, any valid residence permit that you have will become void and you must leave the country.
You will usually be given a deadline by which you must leave Finland.
If you do not leave Finland before the deadline, the police or Border Guard will remove you from the country.
According to the law, you will not be deported if you are in danger of the death penalty, torture, persecution or other inhumane or degrading treatment in your home country.

If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
More information on working and running a business in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Employment and entrepreneurship.
Information on residence permits for employees and entrepreneurs can be found on the pages Work in Finland and Moving to Finland as an entrepreneur.
If you already have a residence permit in Finland but are not granted a residence permit extension, the Finnish Immigration Service makes a deportation decision.
If you commit crimes in Finland, you can also be deported based on the crimes.
If you are deported, any valid residence permit that you have will become void and you must leave the country.
You will usually be given a deadline by which you must leave Finland.
If you do not leave Finland before the deadline, the police or Border Guard will remove you from the country.
According to the law, you will not be deported if you are in danger of the death penalty, torture, persecution or other inhumane or degrading treatment in your home country.

In addition to this, support services are available, which include meal, cleaning, shopping, security and transport services.
If you require home care, please contact the home care unit of your municipality.
Municipal home care is subject to a fee.
When the home care is regular, your income and that of your spouse affect the cost of the home care.
Temporary home care costs the same for everyone.
The municipality may also provide you with a service voucher you can use to purchase services from a service provider approved by the municipality.
Health
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you are entitled to use public health services.
If you fall ill, contact your local health centre.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Health services in Finland.
Taking care of a family member at home
When a family member needs help continuously and his/her care is binding and demanding, it is possible to get allowance for informal care (omaishoidontuki) for it.
This allowance is intended for people who have a municipality of residence in Finland.
The amount of the allowance and the criteria for getting it may vary from one municipality to another.
You can apply for the allowance at the Social Welfare Office (sosiaalitoimisto) of your own municipality.
In order to qualify for this allowance, you must make an informal care agreement (omaishoitosopimus) with your municipality.
Your local Social Welfare Office will provide more information about the allowance for informal care.
In addition to the remuneration, municipalities can organise various services in order to support informal care.
Municipalities also arrange daytime activities (päivätoiminta) for the elderly.
Daytime activities include transport, a meal, exercise, for example.
Ask for more information at your local Social Welfare Office.

Early childhood education is intended for children under school age.
In Finland, municipalities offer municipal early childhood education at day-care centres, for example.
There are also private day-care centres.
Early childhood education is education, teaching and care that have been pedagogically planned, with carefully considered goals.
Trained early education teachers and child nurses work in early education.
Usually, either of the parents looks after the child at home until at least the end of the parental leave, in other words, until the child is around nine months old.
If you also look after your child at home after the period of parental leave, you are entitled to leave from work for childcare purposes until the child’s third birthday.
You can find more information about leave on the InfoFinland page Family leave.
You can apply for financial support for childcare at home from Kela.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
Municipal early childhood education
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you can apply for a place in municipal early childhood education for your child after the period of parental leave.
At that point, the child will be approximately nine months old.
If you do not have an official municipality of residence in Finland, you are considered a resident of the municipality in which you reside.
If both parents work, their child has the right to full-time early education.
If one parent is at home, the child’s right to early education depends on their municipality of residence.
In some municipalities, the child may have a right to full-time early education even if one parent is at home.
In other municipalities, the child has a right to 20 hours of early education per week if one parent is at home.
However, the family can apply for a right to full-time early education if the child needs special support with learning Finnish or because of a difficult family situation.
You can apply for a place in
a day care centre (päiväkoti)
At day-care centres, children are in larger groups than in group family day care.
Family day care involves a care provider looking after the children in his or her own home.
Some family day care providers look after children in the children's home.
Apply for a municipal early childhood education place from your municipality at least four months before your child is due to start day care.
A place can be granted within two weeks if the parents get a job or a student position.
The early education fee (varhaiskasvatusmaksu) depends on
the family’s income;
family size; and
how many hours a week your child will attend early childhood education.
A discount is granted for the day care fees of any siblings.
If the family has a very low income, early childhood education may be free of charge.
For further information, contact the advisory services of your own municipality.
Private early childhood education
The different forms of private early childhood education include:
private day care centres or private group family day care centres
family day care providers or
day care given by a child carer hired by the family to work at their home
You can apply for early childhood education directly from a private day-care centre or a private group family day-care centre.
You can also seek a private family day care provider who will look after children in his or her own home, or hire a child carer to work in your home.
If you hire a child carer to work in your home, you become an employer and must attend to an employer’s obligations.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Employer’s rights and obligations.
You can also hire a child carer together with another family.
The municipality supervises private early childhood education.
The costs of private early childhood education vary.
However, you can receive support for it from Kela.
In such a case, private early childhood education does not necessarily cost much more than municipal early childhood education.
Private day care allowance
If your child has a municipality of residence in Finland, you can apply for private day care allowance from Kela.
The child care provider must be approved by the municipality.
You can apply for private day care allowance (yksityisen hoidon tuki) if
your child is under school age and is placed in a private day care centre; or
your child is looked after by another type of private day care provider.
You cannot apply for private day care allowance if the care provider is a family member of the child or if the child and the carer live in the same household.
Neither can you receive private day care allowance if your child is placed in municipal early childhood education.
The amount of allowance depends on the income of the child's family and on the municipality in which the family resides, among other things.
Kela pays the allowance directly to the hired child carer or other child care provider.
Private day care allowance is taxable income.
This allowance is not paid abroad.
Further information on private day care allowance is available on Kela’s website.

For every child living in Finland and covered by Finnish social security, Kela pays child benefit.
Child benefit is paid until the child turns 17.
You can apply for child benefit from Kela either via Kela's website or by a paper form.
The online service is available in Finnish and Swedish.
You can apply for child benefit at the same time as you apply for maternity allowance.
Apply for child benefit in good time. It will only be paid retroactively for a period of 6 months.
The amount of child benefit for the first child is approximately EUR 100 per month.
There will be a slightly raised child benefit for each following child.
A parent who lives alone with one or several children can get a single-parent supplement to the child benefit for each child.
The child benefit is paid monthly, usually to the mother’s, father’s or another guardian’s bank account.

If you are exposed to radiation, chemical substances or contagious diseases in your work, you can stop working as soon as your pregnancy is established.
You will receive special maternity allowance (erityisäitiysraha) for this time.
Don’t forget to apply for special maternity allowance from Kela within four months of the day you stop working.
Special maternity allowance is not paid to unemployed mothers at all and only in certain cases to students.
Ask for more information at Kela.
You can find out about all the benefits Kela offers for families with children on Kela's website.
Information on benefits for families with childrenFinnish _ Swedish _ English
These pages provide information on the types of financial support that is available to families with children in Finland.
Most of these benefits are applied for from Kela.
Further information on Kela is available on the InfoFinland page Important authorities.
A prerequisite for most types of financial support is that you are covered by Finnish social security or that you have a Municipality of residence in Finland.
Your child’s citizenship does not affect your entitlement to benefits.
However, the parents’ residence permit may affect the financial benefits that the family can obtain.
You may have the right to receive benefits from your native country.
If you are covered by Finnish social security while you are staying abroad, you may receive some of the same benefits which you would be entitled to in Finland.
Child benefit, maternity grant and parental allowances, for example, are also paid abroad.
For instance, if the mother moves to another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland for less than a year during the parental allowance period, she may continue to receive maternity and parental allowance.
Notify

Every child has a right to a good and safe childhood.
Child welfare means that municipal social workers help children and families in problem situations.
We try to solve problems before they grow too big.
Child welfare is always a last resort.
It means that before child welfare is contacted, the child and family are supported at school or a maternity and child health clinic, for example.
Contact with child welfare starts with a child welfare report.
Families can ask child welfare authorities for help themselves.
Child welfare reports can also be submitted by anyone who is concerned for a family’s well-being.
For example, a child’s teacher can contact the child welfare authorities.
Sometimes, parents cannot ensure the child’s well-being.
In such cases, society must intervene in the family situation.
In child welfare, the most important thing is the child’s best interest.
Child welfare supports families in problem situations
You can ask child welfare for help, for example, if the parents are exhausted, or there is a difficult change in the family’s life.
Child welfare also supports families if a child or teenager, for example, abuses alcohol or drugs or commits crimes.
Child welfare has many methods for helping families.
Above all, the goal is non-institutional care, where the child lives with their family.
A social worker can arrange home help or a support person for the family.
If there is violence or substance abuse in the family, a child welfare social worker will intervene.
If the child is not safe at home or the situation with the child is very difficult, a decision can be made to put the child into placement or take them into care.
However, the main aim is always to help the child so that they can continue living at home.
Child welfare services and activities are founded in the law
Child welfare is founded on the Child Welfare Act and international conventions.
The Child Welfare Act applies to all children who live in Finland. The applicability is not dependent on their nationality, religion or culture.

Child Welfare ActFinnish _ Swedish _ English
The society safeguards children’s rights through acts and decrees.
The law stipulates that parents or the child’s guardians are primarily responsible for the child’s well-being and balanced development.
In Finland, punishing children physically (corporal punishment) is against the law.
For example, children must not be hit or pulled by the hair.
Equality is emphasised in Finland.
A mother of a young child can, for example, go to work while the other parent stays at home to take care of the child.
In Finland, both women and men look after and raise children.
Children are encouraged to independent thinking.
A child is allowed, for example, to disagree with his or her parents.
Young people in Finland usually move away from home after coming of age when they begin studying or find a job.
It is common for them to live either alone or with student friends before starting a family.
Education and training is valued in Finland and parents’ encouragement in schooling is important.
Show an interest in your child’s school attendance and take part, for example, in parents’ meetings organised by the school.
It is important to give children and young persons clear rules and boundaries.
Common rules can be agreed upon together with other parents, for example.
Don’t forget that cigarettes and alcohol must not be given to a person who is under 18 years old.
When a youth turns 18 he or she is an adult under the law.
The youth is then a legally competent member of society and has the power of decision over his or her own life.
In some issues, under 18-year-olds also have the right to make their own decisions.
The InfoFinland web page Children provides information about children’s rights according to their age.
There is a lot of help and support available in matters concerning children’s upbringing.
If you need support or you are worried about your child, you should ask, for example, the social services in your own municipality for advice in good time.

A child’s birth is registered at the hospital
What citizenship does the child gain?
If the child is not granted Finnish citizenship
Child’s social security
Recognition of paternity
A child must have a guardian
A child’s birth is registered at the hospital
When a child is born, the hospital registers the birth in the Finnish Population Information System and the child receives a temporary personal identity number.
This is done if:
the child’s mother has a right of residence in Finland.
the mother’s municipality of residence is in Finland,
and the mother has a Finnish personal identity number.
If the mother has not been registered in Finland, the hospital cannot register the birth and the local register office will not send the appropriate form to the mother.
If this is the case, please contact the local register office and ask for instructions on how to register your child.
Read more about the mother’s registration on the InfoFinland page Registering as a resident.
Contact information for Local Register OfficesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
The local register office will send a form to the mother’s home within two weeks of the birth registration.
This form is used to inform the authorities of the following:
native language
religion
Please fill in the form carefully and sign it.
If the child’s parents are married, both parents must sign the form.
Return the form to the local register office within two months of the child’s birth.
You can send the form by post or take it to the local register office of your area of residence in person.
You child will not be registered in the Population Information System before this.
Finland has a Names Act. According to the Act, all persons with a place of residence in Finland must have a last name and 1–4 first names.
The first names must be compliant with the Finnish Names Act.
For example, siblings may not be given the same first name.
A child receives the last name from his/her parents.
When the parents have a common last name, that becomes the child’s last name.
If the parents have different last names, the child’s last name will depend on the situation.
If the parents are married, they can choose either spouse’s last name for their child.
If the parents are not married, the child can have either the mother’s last name, or father’s last name if paternity has been confirmed.
Read more about the confirmation of paternity in Section “Recognition of paternity” on this page.
If the parents’ last name is a double last name formed by combining their last names, that becomes the child’s last name.
If the parents have previous children together, the underage siblings must have the same last name.
If the parents are divorced, the child’s guardian will decide the last name.
In the event that the parents fail to agree upon the child’s last name, the child will receive the mother’s last name.
The brochure "Spouse's Surname and Child's Surname"Finnish _ Swedish _ English

Child’s native language
When a child is born, a native language must be registered for him/her.
It is mandatory to register a native language.
You can choose only one language as your child’s native language.
You can change the language later if you wish.
It is a good idea to think about what language you want to register for your child.
It may affect what language the child can study at school.
Children whose native language is something other than Finnish or Swedish will study Finnish or Swedish as a foreign language, i.e. S2 teaching.
Your child can also study his/her native language if it is registered as something other than Finnish or Swedish.
Studying the native language is voluntary.

Child’s religion
The child’s religion is a matter to be decided inside the family.
You have the right to decide the religion to which the child belongs.
Registering a religion is not mandatory.
If one of the parents is the child’s sole guardian, he or she can decide the child’s religion.

What citizenship does the child gain?
The child’s citizenship is dependent on the citizenship of the parents.
A newborn child is granted Finnish citizenship if:
the child’s mother is a Finnish citizen;
the child’s father is a Finnish citizen and the parents are married;
the child’s father is a Finnish citizen, the child is born in Finland out of wedlock, and the father’s paternity is confirmed;
the child’s father has died before childbirth, but he was a Finnish citizen and married to the child’s mother upon his death; or
the child’s father has died before childbirth, the child is born in Finland out of wedlock, and the father’s paternity has been confirmed;
The child will also be granted Finnish citizenship if he or she is born in Finland and does not gain the citizenship of any other state from the parents.
In these cases, the Finnish Immigration Service determines the child’s citizenship.
A child may be a Finnish citizen and the citizen of another country at the same time. This depends on whether or not the other country in question accepts multinationality.
Ask the diplomatic mission of your country about the matter.

A child must have a guardian
In Finland, a person under the age of 18 is legally a child.
Persons under 18 years of age must always have at least one guardian.
Usually, the child’s parents are the guardians.
Both parents of a child born in wedlock are regarded as the guardians.
If the parents are not married and paternity has not been recognised, the child’s guardian is the mother, who is the sole decider of the child’s affairs.
In other words, the mother makes the decisions regarding the child even if the parents live together.
The father will be granted custody if the parents agree upon joint custody and the paternity has been recognised.
The custody agreement is completed before the child’s birth at the maternity and child health clinic or, after birth, by visiting the municipal child welfare officer.

A child’s birth is registered at the hospital
When a child is born, the hospital registers the birth in the Finnish Population Information System and the child receives a temporary personal identity number.
This is done if:
the child’s mother has a right of residence in Finland.
the mother’s municipality of residence is in Finland,
and the mother has a Finnish personal identity number.
If the mother has not been registered in Finland, the hospital cannot register the birth and the local register office will not send the appropriate form to the mother.
If this is the case, please contact the local register office and ask for instructions on how to register your child.
Read more about the mother’s registration on the InfoFinland page Registering as a resident.

If the parents are not married, the child can have either the mother’s last name, or father’s last name if paternity has been confirmed.
Read more about the confirmation of paternity in Section “Recognition of paternity” on this page.
If the parents’ last name is a double last name formed by combining their last names, that becomes the child’s last name.
If the parents have previous children together, the underage siblings must have the same last name.

The registration period for pre-primary education beginning in August opens in January.
A letter with more detailed information on pre-primary school registration is sent to parents of pre-school age children.
This information is also available on the early education providers’ websites
All families wanting their children to attend pre-primary education must submit an application.
In most cases, pre-primary school enrolment is done online. Application forms can be used if online enrolment is not possible.

A common-law relationship is dissolved when the spouses no longer live at the same address.
The termination of a common-law relationship may affect such things as Kela benefits and your child's day care fees.
You yourself are responsible for notifying authorities of the termination of your common-law relationship.
If common-law spouses have children together and these children are under the age of 18, they must make decisions concerning them just as couples getting divorced do.
Common-law spouses may also receive help in making these decisions from for example family mediation.

During a common-law relationship, each party maintains his or her own property.
When a common-law relationship is terminated, property is usually divided in accordance with what belongs to whom.
If a common-law husband and wife acquire property together, both parties must be recorded as buyers and all the relevant receipts must be kept.
In such a case, this property is divided in half if the common-law relationship ends.
If only one of the spouses is recorded as the buyer, this property will belong to him or her when the common-law relationship ends.
Common-law spouses may also have property the ownership of which has not been discussed.
In this case, it is assumed that both parties own an equal share and the property in question is divided in half.
If common-law spouses cannot decide how to divide their property they can in some cases ask a District Court to provide them with an executor for division of property.
You can only request a District Court to grant you an executor if your common-law marriage has lasted for at least five years or if you have children together.
In some cases, one spouse may receive compensation from the other when they separate.
A common-law spouse may receive compensation if he or she has, for example, worked for his or her spouse and thus enabled him or her to add to his or her property and thus division of property based solely on ownership would be unjust.
If a common-law relationship ends in one of the partner’s death, the common-law husband and wife do not inherit from each other.
A common-law husband and wife have no right, for example, to stay and live in the family’s shared home if it is the property of the dead partner.
The inheritance goes to the children or siblings of the dead partner.
Common-law spouses may, however, make a will (testamentti) in case one of them dies.
By this will, they can ensure that certain property, for example a home they have purchased together, will go to the other spouse in the event of the other's death.
Common-law spouses may also make a written contract on how their property is to be divided in case their relationship comes to an end.
If you would like to make a will or a contract on how your property is to be divided in case of separation, ask for advice from a legal aid office or a lawyer.

If your family includes children under the age of 18 and your marriage comes to an end, you need to agree on the following things during the divorce process:
where will your child live
who will be the child’s guardian
how will visitation rights be organised
child maintenance support
When the parents have agreed where their child is to live, who will be his or her guardian, what the visitation arrangements will be and who will pay what as child maintenance support, their local social services may confirm the agreement.
An agreement confirmed by social services is as official as a court decision.
More information is available at your local social services.

Divorce in FinlandEnglish _ Russian _ Estonian
If you are unable to reach an agreement
If you are unable to reach an agreement concerning living arrangements, guardianship, visitation rights and child maintenance support, you can seek help from family mediation (perheasioiden sovittelu).
If you cannot reach an agreement despite mediation, you must ask your District Court to give a ruling on the matter.
The court will take into consideration the child’s best interest and his or her own wishes.
The court will also ask the social services of your municipality to give a report on your situation.
Ask more about family mediation from the social services of your municipality.
More information on the services provided by lawyers and on legal aid is available on the InfoFinland web page Do you need a lawyer?
Living arrangements
Always consider the child’s best interest while making decisions on his or her living arrangements.
Officially a child can only live at one address.
During the divorce process, parents will agree which one of their homes will be the child’s official home.
In practice, however, the child can also live part-time at the other parent’s home.
Child benefit will be paid to the parent officially living with the child.
The child’s official address also has an impact on Kela housing allowance, for example.
Guardianship
The guardianship of a child entails
raising the child
managing the child's affairs and making decisions concerning him or her.
The child’s guardian is also entitled to receive information regarding the child from officials.
When a marriage is dissolved, the parents of a child decide how guardianship will be arranged.
Parents can agree to have joint custody of their child or that one of the parents will have sole custody.
Guardianship is not automatically granted to the parent with whom the child lives.
Read more about joint and sole custody on the InfoFinland web page Single parent families.
Joint custody and single parenthoodFinnish
Visitation rights
A child has the right to maintain contact with both of his or her parents after divorce.
He or she also has the right to visit the parent with whom he or she does not live.
Visitation rights can entail, for example, that a child lives with one parent and visits the other parent every other weekend and on certain times during holidays.
If the child is very young, he or she can meet their other parent during day visits only.
Visitation rights can also be so extensive that the child will spend an equal amount of time with each parent.
Officially, however, a child can only have one address.
Always consider your child’s best interest while making decisions concerning him or her.
When you separate, you can agree in advance how often your child will visit the parent living elsewhere.
If you wish, you can also draw a written contract on visitation arrangements.
You can also decide that you will agree on each visitation separately.
How to organise visitationFinnish
If you are having problems with visitation
If you have made an agreement on visitation arrangements, but the parent living with the child does not abide by this agreement, you can contact a child welfare supervisor of the municipality in which the child lives.
The child welfare supervisor will then arrange a meeting with the parents.
If you suspect that your child’s health or safety is being compromised when he or she is visiting the other parent, share your concerns with social service staff.
If there are grounds for your worries, a court can give a ruling stating that social services must be present when your child meets his or her other parent.
Child maintenance support
Both parents are responsible for the maintenance of their children under the age of 18, even if they no longer live together.
The parent who does not live with the child pays child maintenance support to the parent living with the child.
Read more about child maintenance support on the InfoFinland web page Single parent families.
Information for parents liable for maintenanceFinnish
Child’s last name in a divorce
When the parents get a divorce, the child’s last name remains the same.
The last name can also be changed.
Send an application for a change of name to the Local Registry Office.
If the child is over 12 years old, he/she must be asked for a written permission to change his/her last name.
Even if the child is under 12 years old, it is a good idea to discuss the change of last name with the child beforehand.
Child abductions (lapsikaappaus)
A child abduction involves
taking a child, who is residing in Finland and is under 16 years of age, abroad without the guardian’s consent
not returning a child, who has been taken abroad, to Finland at the agreed time.
Child abduction is a crime in Finland.
Contact your local police.

When a marriage ends in divorce, you and your spouse may agree how to divide your property.
You may also agree which one of you will be allowed to live in the family home for the time being.
Help in dividing property
If you and your spouse are not able to agree on how to divide your property, either party can ask for a division of property (ositus).
Division of property can be done immediately after the first divorce application has been filed.
You do not need to wait for the six-month reconsideration period to pass.
After you have requested for division of property, the District Court will appoint an executor who will divide your property.
The executor will be paid for his or her work.
At the beginning of the division process, an account on the property and debts of each spouse must be given.
The website ‘Guide to Finnish Law’ contains information on the documents you will need for division of property.
More information on division of property is available on the Ministry of Justice website.
Will the property be divided equally or not?
In divorce situations, property is usually divided equally among both spouses.
In exceptional cases property is not divided equally.
In these cases, division of property is often mediated.
This means that it is considered what is reasonable in the situation at hand.
For example, if the marriage has lasted less than five years, property is not necessarily divided equally.
Division of property can only be mediated if one of the spouses so requests.
If you have signed a marital contract, this affects how your property will be divided in divorce.
More information on marital contracts is available on the InfoFinland web page Marital contract.

Examination of impediments to marriage
Before you can get married, an examination of impediments to marriage (avioliiton esteiden tutkinta) must be carried out.
In the examination of impediments, the authorities clarify whether there are impediments to the marriage according to Finnish law.
You can request an examination of impediments from any Local Register Office (maistraatti).
The examination must be requested in writing and in person.
The examination takes approximately a week.
When it is ready, you will receive a certificate.
It is valid for four months.
The examination certificate has to be taken along to the marriage ceremony.
The Local Register Office examines any impediments to the marriage based on the information registered in the Finnish Population Information System.
If there is no information about your marital status in the Finnish Population Information System, you must submit a marital status certificate (siviilisäätytodistus), provided by the authorities of your home country, to the Local Register Office.
You can also obtain the certificate from the embassy or consulate of your home country in Finland.
If neither spouse is a Finnish citizen or lives in Finland, they must, in addition to the marital status certificates, submit to the Local Register Office a clarification on whether the legislation in their home country allows them to get married in Finland.
Please note that it may take several weeks to examine the impediments if certificates from other countries are required.
Legalisation and translation of certificates
Foreign certificates usually have to be legalised and translated into Finnish, Swedish or English.
The translation must also be legalised.
If the translation is done by a translator authorised by Finland or another EU state, the translation does not need to be legalised.
Certificates provided by an authority of a Nordic or EU country do not need to be legalised.
A certificate granted by an embassy or a consulate located in Finland does not need to be legalised, either.
If the certificate has been granted by an authority of an EU country and is supplemented with the form EU 2016/1191, the certificate does not need to be translated.

Single parent families are common in Finland.
A child may be born out of wedlock or the child’s parents have divorced.
A single-parent family is one where one of the parents lives with their children without a spouse.
In this case, the parent may be a single parent or joint custody parent.
A single parent bears the sole responsibility for their child’s upbringing.
A joint custody parent agrees upon their child’s affairs with the other parent.
In joint custody, parents decide on many things together, including the child’s
place of residence
upbringing
language
religion
education
health care
using the child’s property
Joint custody requires that the parents are able to work together for the best interests of their child.
For example, a passport application must have both parents’ consent.
A single parent makes all the decisions concerning the child themselves.
Authorities, such as the day-care centre and school, only give information about the child to the guardian.
The other parent can, however, make decisions regarding the care and upbringing of the child when the child is staying with him or her.
When parents get a divorce, whether they are married or in a common-law relationship, they must decide on their children’s guardianship, maintenance, accommodation and visiting rights.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Children in a divorce.
A child can also be adopted alone.
If you would like to adopt a child alone, ask the social services office of your municipality for advice.
The Association of Single Parent Families (Yhden Vanhemman Perheiden Liitto) offers information and organises activities for single parent families.
You can find out about the Child Custody and Right of Access Act on the Finlex website.

Child maintenance support
Both parents are responsible for the maintenance of their children under the age of 18, even if they no longer live together.
When parents separate, they have to reach an agreement concerning the maintenance of their children and possible child maintenance support (elatusapu).
The amount of child maintenance support is calculated on the basis on the child’s maintenance needs and the parents' maintenance capacity.
The child’s maintenance needs refer to the sum of money that is needed to support the child on a monthly basis.
It includes, for example, food and clothing costs and possible day care fees.
The child’s maintenance needs are divided between the parents in accordance with their maintenance capacity.
Maintenance capacity is calculated by subtracting taxes and other obligatory costs from the parent’s income.
You can ask your municipality’s child welfare supervisor (lastenvalvoja) to help you calculate the amount of child maintenance support.
It is advisable to make a written agreement on child maintenance support and have the Social Welfare Board confirm this agreement.
An agreement confirmed by the Social Welfare Board is just as official as a court decision.
Ask a child welfare supervisor of your municipality to provide you with the Social Welfare Board confirmation.
If parents cannot reach an agreement concerning child maintenance support, they can ask family mediation to help.
Ultimately, the matter will be solved in a district court.
More information on family mediation is available on the InfoFinland web page Divorce.
Child maintenance allowance
In some situations, the parent who is living with the child can apply for child maintenance allowance (elatustuki) from Kela.
You can apply for child maintenance allowance from Kela if:
a parent liable for maintenance has not paid the established child support (Kela will recover it from the person afterwards).
child support has been established as smaller than child maintenance allowance due to the financial situation of a parent who is liable for the child’s maintenance.
child support has not been established as payable at all due to the financial situation of the parent liable for maintenance.
the paternity of a child born out of wedlock has not been confirmed.
You may also receive child maintenance allowance, if you have moved to Finland permanently.
You may also receive child maintenance allowance if you have come to Finland to work from another EU or EEA member state or Switzerland.
The child for whom child maintenance allowance is applied for must also reside in Finland.
You can ask Kela for more information on child maintenance allowance.

If one of you is a member of an Evangelical Lutheran or Orthodox Church, you can ask for an examination of impediments also from your own parish.
The examination is compulsory and without it the marriage cannot take place.
The examination reveals, for example, if someone is already married to someone else.
In Finland, this examination takes approximately a week.
It is valid for four months.
If the marriage does not take place in that time, the examination has to be repeated.
The examination certificate has to be taken along to the marriage ceremony.
Coming to Finland as a spouse
The impediments to marriage are investigated according to Finnish law, if you are a Finnish citizen or live permanently in Finland and your data is recorded in the population register.
If a foreign person’s information cannot be verified from the population register, he or she must provide the local register office with documentation from the officials of his or her native country for the examination of impediments to marriage.
This may take some time because different countries have different conventions.
You can ask for more information on the necessary documentation from your local register office.
In addition, a foreign partner will require an identity card, a certificate of marital status (unmarried, divorced, widow/widower) and an apostille certificate for the aforementioned documents.
The apostille certificate proves that the document provided by an authority has been granted by an authorised person.
Each Hague Convention country has an authority who hands out the apostille.
A list of the Convention countries can be found in English on the website of Hague Conference on Private International Law.
Documents brought from other countries must have a stamp that proves that the document is legitimate.
This stamp has to be requested from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country in question and, in addition, a Finnish Diplomatic Mission in the country.
Ask for more information at a Diplomatic Mission of your own country.

Definition of a family
A family in Finland is formed by
spouses
common-law husband and wife
under 18-year-old unmarried child or children and their guardian or guardians living in Finland
The Finnish concept of a family is narrower than that of many other countries.
In Finland, a family is most often considered to consist of the nuclear family, i.e. the parents and children.
For example, if grandparents, parents and children live together in the same home, officially only the parents and children form a family.
The grandparents are a separate family of their own.
A family may include children or a childless couple can form a family.
The adults of a family can be of the opposite or same sex.
A family can also consist of a single mother or father and his or her children.
A stepfamily refers to a couple that has a child or several children from the couple’s previous relationships living with them.
The couple may also have children together.
If you are divorced, you can remarry without the permission of your previous spouse.
According to Finnish law, you do not need permission from your previous spouse to remarry even if you have had children together.
Rainbow families
Rainbow families are families of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transsexual parents and their children.
They include, for example, families with same-sex parents and families that have more than two parents.
If spouses of the same sex are married, they have the right to adopt a child or carry out an adoption inside the family.
Adoption inside the family means that a spouse adopts the child of his or her spouse and officially becomes the second parent of that child.
In Finland, a child can have no more than two legal guardians.
If you are planning an adoption inside your family, contact the social services office of your municipality.
The Rainbow Families Association is an association that supports and advises rainbow families and organises activities for them.
Contact information can be found on the website of the association.

Maintenance liability
According to Finnish law, parents are obliged to take financial care of their underage children and spouses of each other.
Maintenance liability for family members does not extend to other relatives, such as grown-up siblings or grandparents.
In Finland, private people are not expected to look after their relatives who are in a poorer financial situation than they are.
The necessary support is given by the society in the form of social security.
Household
People living permanently in the same dwelling together belong in the same household.
To find out more about households, go to the InfoFinland web page Accommodation.
A couple’s relationship
A couple can choose whether they want to live together in a common-law relationship or in a marriage.
It is worth noting that the form of a relationship has an influence on the spouses’ rights and obligations, property and inheritance issues, as well as the custody, maintenance and adoption of a child.

Single parent families are common in Finland.
A child may be born out of wedlock or the child’s parents have divorced.
A single-parent family is one where one of the parents lives with their children without a spouse.
In this case, the parent may be a single parent or joint custody parent.
A single parent bears the sole responsibility for their child’s upbringing.
A joint custody parent agrees upon their child’s affairs with the other parent.
In joint custody, parents decide on many things together, including the child’s
place of residence
upbringing
language
religion
education
health care
using the child’s property
Joint custody requires that the parents are able to work together for the best interests of their child.
For example, a passport application must have both parents’ consent.
A single parent makes all the decisions concerning the child themselves.
Authorities, such as the day-care centre and school, only give information about the child to the guardian.
The other parent can, however, make decisions regarding the care and upbringing of the child when the child is staying with him or her.
When parents get a divorce, whether they are married or in a common-law relationship, they must decide on their children’s guardianship, maintenance, accommodation and visiting rights.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Children in a divorce.
A child can also be adopted alone.
If you would like to adopt a child alone, ask the social services office of your municipality for advice.

Child maintenance support
Both parents are responsible for the maintenance of their children under the age of 18, even if they no longer live together.
When parents separate, they have to reach an agreement concerning the maintenance of their children and possible child maintenance support (elatusapu).
The amount of child maintenance support is calculated on the basis on the child’s maintenance needs and the parents' maintenance capacity.
The child’s maintenance needs refer to the sum of money that is needed to support the child on a monthly basis.
It includes, for example, food and clothing costs and possible day care fees.
The child’s maintenance needs are divided between the parents in accordance with their maintenance capacity.
Maintenance capacity is calculated by subtracting taxes and other obligatory costs from the parent’s income.
You can ask your municipality’s child welfare supervisor (lastenvalvoja) to help you calculate the amount of child maintenance support.
It is advisable to make a written agreement on child maintenance support and have the Social Welfare Board confirm this agreement.
An agreement confirmed by the Social Welfare Board is just as official as a court decision.
Ask a child welfare supervisor of your municipality to provide you with the Social Welfare Board confirmation.
If parents cannot reach an agreement concerning child maintenance support, they can ask family mediation to help.
Ultimately, the matter will be solved in a district court.
More information on family mediation is available on the InfoFinland web page Divorce.
Child maintenance allowance
In some situations, the parent who is living with the child can apply for child maintenance allowance (elatustuki) from Kela.
You can apply for child maintenance allowance from Kela if:
a parent liable for maintenance has not paid the established child support (Kela will recover it from the person afterwards).
child support has been established as smaller than child maintenance allowance due to the financial situation of a parent who is liable for the child’s maintenance.
child support has not been established as payable at all due to the financial situation of the parent liable for maintenance.
the paternity of a child born out of wedlock has not been confirmed.
You may also receive child maintenance allowance, if you have moved to Finland permanently.
You may also receive child maintenance allowance if you have come to Finland to work from another EU or EEA member state or Switzerland.

Applying for services
You often need a medical certificate to get services for the disabled.
Visit your local health centre, for example, for a medical examination.
Once you have a doctor's certificate, contact the social services office of your municipality of residence.
Municipalities have a social worker who is responsible for the services for disabled persons.
You can ask this person for guidance and advice in applying for services.
Its purpose is to find out what services for disabled persons you can obtain.
A decision will be made on the services. You can appeal against the decision if you are not happy with the services provided to you.
Housing
Municipalities organise service housing and supported housing for disabled persons who need help and support in housing.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Supported and service housing.
Aids
Your health centre and central hospital will pay for aids, which are given as medical rehabilitation (lääkinnällinen kuntoutus).
This means that you do not have to pay anything for the aids and equipment that you need to manage in your daily life.
Such free-of-charge aids include, for example, wheelchairs, hearing aids for the hearing impaired and white canes and guide dogs for the visually impaired.
If you need alteration work in your home, or some disability equipment have to be installed there, your municipality of residence may reimburse you for them.
For example, your home can be changed in such a way that it is possible to get about in a wheelchair.
Fixed disability equipment include, for example, various types of hoisting equipment and a fire alarm and doorbell for hearing impaired in which sound is replaced by light.
The social worker of your municipality’s Office for Disabled Services will estimate together with you whether your home needs alteration work.
Kela may pay for aids that are required for working and studying.
You may be provided with aids if you cannot manage work or studying without certain aids or if work or study without them would be very difficult.
You can ask at Kela how to get these aids.

Care in family surroundings (perhehoito) means that the person’s treatment, education, upbringing and care take place in a private home outside his/her own home.
This is a very suitable form of housing for a person with mental disabilities who requires treatment.
This can be either a temporary or a more permanent arrangement.
Care in family surroundings can also be provided in the home of the person who requires treatment.
If a person with mental disabilities requires care at all times and cannot be given it at home or in a service apartment, he/she can also live in an institution (laitos).

Definition of a family
A family in Finland is formed by
spouses
common-law husband and wife
under 18-year-old unmarried child or children and their guardian or guardians living in Finland
The Finnish concept of a family is narrower than that of many other countries.
In Finland, a family is most often considered to consist of the nuclear family, i.e. the parents and children.
For example, if grandparents, parents and children live together in the same home, officially only the parents and children form a family.
The grandparents are a separate family of their own.
A family may include children or a childless couple can form a family.
The adults of a family can be of the opposite or same sex.
A family can also consist of a single mother or father and his or her children.
A stepfamily refers to a couple that has a child or several children from the couple’s previous relationships living with them.
The couple may also have children together.
If you are divorced, you can remarry without the permission of your previous spouse.
According to Finnish law, you do not need permission from your previous spouse to remarry even if you have had children together.
Rainbow families
Rainbow families are families of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transsexual parents and their children.
They include, for example, families with same-sex parents and families that have more than two parents.
If spouses of the same sex are married, they have the right to adopt a child or carry out an adoption inside the family.
Adoption inside the family means that a spouse adopts the child of his or her spouse and officially becomes the second parent of that child.
In Finland, a child can have no more than two legal guardians.
If you are planning an adoption inside your family, contact the social services office of your municipality.
The Rainbow Families Association is an association that supports and advises rainbow families and organises activities for them.
Contact information can be found on the website of the association.

Self-care medication (itsehoitolääke) can be bought without a doctor’s prescription.
For example, most painkillers are regarded as self-care medication.
However, for many medicines you will need a prescription (lääkemääräys) before you can buy them.
Antibiotics, for example, are prescription drugs.
A prescription is written by a doctor.
Also part of the nurses are allowed to prescribe certain medicines.
If you have a long-term illness, take your old prescriptions to the doctor’s surgery, and the doctor will take them into account when writing a new one.
If the doctor gives you an electronic prescription (sähköinen resepti), you can buy your medication at the pharmacy without a printed prescription.
A prescription is valid for two years from the date it was written.
If you have a prescription that you have acquired abroad, it is not valid in Finland.
Prescriptions that have been written in another Nordic country and EU cross-border prescriptions are an exception and are valid in Finland.
You must specifically ask for an EU cross-border prescription from your doctor.
Health care specialists who work in an EU or EEA country or Switzerland and are entitled to prescribe medicines are allowed to issue EU cross-border prescriptions.
The product’s use-by date is indicated on the medicine package.
If the medicine is out-of-date, it should not be used.
Do not throw away old medicines; instead, always take them to the pharmacy (apteekki), because they are hazardous waste.

The initial deductible does not apply to persons under 18 years of age.
You can receive the reimbursement immediately at the pharmacy when buying a product.
The reimbursement is deducted from the price of the medicine at the cash desk.
You can also apply for the reimbursement afterwards by filling in the appropriate form.
Attach to the form the calculation of the medicine purchase given to you at the pharmacy and the sales receipt.

Medication from abroad
You are allowed to bring some medicines to Finland with you from abroad for your personal use.
There are, however, restrictions on the imports of medicines.
These restrictions depend on what kind of medication it is and the country from which it is brought to Finland.
In addition, you must be able to prove with a prescription or medical certificate, for example, that the medicine is intended for your personal use.
Please find out about any restrictions before bringing medicine to Finland.
You also need to find out about restrictions, if you want to order medicine by post to Finland.

By post, you can order medication from countries within the EEA in the amount that corresponds to no more than three months’ use.
From outside the EEA, you can bring with you medication to Finland for personal use in the amount that corresponds to no more than three months’ use.
The law stipulates that medicine cannot be ordered by post from outside the EEA area.
If a medicine has been classified as a drug, stricter restrictions apply to it.
If you are unsure whether a medicine can be brought to Finland, ask for more information at the Customs (Tulli).
If you order medicines from abroad, you are not entitled to reimbursement for them from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela).
There are some online pharmacies in EU countries from which you can legally buy self-care medicine.
However, the majority of the medicine stores on the internet are illegal.
You may also put your health at risk if you buy medicine from an illegal medicine store on the internet.

Information on maternity and child health clinic servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian
See a doctor
See a maternity doctor clinic before the end of the 4th month of pregnancy.
You can usually book an appointment with the doctor through the maternity clinic.
When you see the doctor for an examination, you will receive a certificate of pregnancy.
You will need the certificate if you apply to your employer for maternity leave.
You will also need the certificate if you apply for a maternity grant (äitiysavustus) and maternity allowance (äitiysraha) from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela).
Find out more about these benefits on the InfoFinland page Support for pregnant women.
The page Finnish social security explains who has a right to Kela benefits.
Private maternity clinics
There are also private maternity clinics in Finland.
Please take into account the fact that private health care services are subject to a charge.
Read more on the page Health services in Finland.
Genital mutilation and pregnancy
If you have been subjected to genital mutilation, a surgical opening operation can be done for you.
It will ease examinations during pregnancy.
It will also make it easier for you to give birth.
The opening operation can also be performed before you become pregnant, during mid-pregnancy or during childbirth.
The maternity clinic nurse will ask you whether you have been subjected to genital mutilation.
It is very important to tell her about it so that she can refer you to an opening operation.
Childbirth
In Finland, women usually give birth in a hospital.
Ask the maternity clinic which hospital you need to go to give birth.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, childbirth will not cost much.
The other parent of the baby can be present during the birth.
If you want, you can also invite another relative or friend to join you.
Most mothers in Finland give birth the traditional way.
It is usually the safest way.
If this is not possible, the doctor will make a decision about performing a C-section.
If you are afraid of childbirth, mention it at the maternity clinic.
Help can be given for your fear, for example, at the Fear of Childbirth Outpatient Clinic (synnytyspelkopoliklinikka).
After childbirth, you will usually spend a few days at the hospital with the baby.
The other parent or another support person can be with you at the hospital, helping you throughout the day.
If you are giving birth to your first child, the support person can usually also spend the nights at the hospital with you.
When you go to the hospital, bring along some clothes for the baby that are warm enough for the journey home.
If you plan to take your baby home by car, you will need a baby car seat (turvakaukalo).
Interpretation during childbirth
It is not possible to know the exact time of birth in advance.
For this reason, it may be difficult to book an interpreter for the birth.
Some interpreter agencies are on call at weekends, in evenings and at nights.
You can find out more about interpreter services in your municipality at your maternity clinic.
Read more about interpreter services on the InfoFinland page
After the child is born
The page When a child is born in Finland contains important information on practical matters that you need to handle after the child is born.
There is information about, for example, registering the children in the Population Information System, the Finnish Act on Forenames and Surnames and the child’s social security.
Help with the baby
If you feel that you cannot cope alone with the baby, you can practise caring for the baby at a Mother and Child Home.
Ask for more information about the activities at your maternity clinic.
You need a referral from your municipality for the Mother and Child Home.

In Finland, it is possible to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages in the following situations:
if childbirth would pose a danger to your health
if you are younger than 17 or older than 40
if you have already given birth to four children
if you are unable to take care of the child due to an illness.
It is sufficient reason for an abortion (abortti) if giving birth to or taking care of the child would be a considerable strain in your life situation.
In practice, one of the following can be considered sufficient reason:
family relations
work situation
housing
A woman has the right to decide herself whether she wants to ask for an abortion.
Her partner can participate in the decision-making, if she wants to take his opinion into account.
If you are a minor and wish to ask for an abortion, you do not need your parents’ permission for it.
Nevertheless, it is often good to talk about it with your parents.
If you choose not to, the health care professionals are under an obligation of secrecy.
Abortion must be performed before the twelfth week of pregnancy.
If there is an extremely strong reason, it can be performed later, but a special permit granted by Valvira, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira) is then required.
Valvira’s permission is also required if the abortion is performed due to the serious illness or impairment of the foetus.
Ask a doctor at your health centre (terveysasema) for more information.
If you wish to terminate a pregnancy, contact the health centre of your own area as soon as possible and make a doctor’s appointment.
You can also make an appointment with a private doctor, but when you make it, make sure that the doctor has a licence granted by Valvira for issuing a statement for the abortion.
If you wish, you can take your partner along to the see the doctor.
The doctor will write you a referral to the hospital where the abortion will be performed.
At the hospital, a nurse and doctor will discuss the matter with you.
Together you will decide on the way that the pregnancy will be terminated.
This is affected by the length of the pregnancy and your own opinion.
Abortion is performed either with medication or by surgery (kaavinta).
Surgery is usually performed under anaesthesia, after which you will have to stay at the hospital for a few hours.
If the abortion is performed with medication, the drugs are dosed every 1-3 days via the vagina, causing the womb to contract and shed its lining together with the foetus.
Be prepared to take some painkillers when the womb begins to contract.
Sometimes, in addition to drugs, surgery is also required.
Two to four weeks after the abortion, you will have a follow-up examination at the health centre.
When making a decision about abortion, you will be supported, for example, by the health centre’s nurse or doctor.
For more information about places where you can get help in a challenging situation in life, go to the InfoFinland web page Mental health.

You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
Treatment guarantee (hoitotakuu)
If you are in need of urgent care, for example, after being in an accident, you have the right to immediate help at the nearest health centre’s or hospital’s emergency clinic.
If you have no municipality of residence in Finland, or you have no other grounds for the right to use public health services in Finland, you must pay the price for these health services in accordance with their actual costs.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you are entitled to use the public health services of your own municipality.
On weekdays during office hours, health centres must answer patients’ phone calls or be open to receive patients.
If the situation demands it, you have the right to a visit to a health centre within three weekdays of requesting an appointment.
Health centres are also obliged to begin non-urgent treatment within three months at the latest.
Hospitals admit patients with a doctor’s referral.
Hospitals must estimate the need for treatment within three weeks of the arrival of the doctor’s referral to the hospital.
If it is discovered that the patient requires hospital care, treatment must be begun at the latest within six months from the assessment of the need for care.
If the patient’s own health centre or hospital cannot treat the patient within the prescribed time, the health centre or hospital must arrange an opportunity for the patient to receive treatment elsewhere.
No extra cost for this must be incurred for the patient.

Equality in health services
According to the Finnish Constitution, all people are equal in the eyes of the law.
Without acceptable grounds, nobody can be placed in a different position based on their gender, age, origin, language, religion, beliefs, opinions, health, disability or other personal reason.
The Non-Discrimination Act is also in force in Finland.
The Act is applied to discrimination on the basis of origin in public and private social and health services, for example.
The Non-Discrimination Ombudsman and the National Discrimination and Equality Tribunal ensure that nobody is discriminated against because of his or her ethnic background.
All health service clients have the right to equal treatment without discrimination.
If you are not entitled to use public health services, you have the right to equal treatment in private health services.
Discrimination and unfair treatment in health services
If you feel that you have been treated unfairly within health services, please contact the patient ombudsman (potilasasiamies).
The help of the patient ombudsman is offered in all the places where health services are provided, for example at health centres, in hospitals, at private clinics, in homes for the elderly and institutions for the disabled.
The services of a patient ombudsman are free.
Ask for the contact information of the patient ombudsman responsible in the unit where you have been treated.
A patient ombudsman helps to resolve disputes and advises and assists if you want to make a complaint or apply for compensation for injury received during treatment.
The ombudsman also informs patients about their rights and promotes their implementation.

In some situations, the authorities can book you an interpreter and pay for it, but this is not always possible.
Ask your local authority about this beforehand.
Interpretation can also be arranged over the phone.
The interpreter must be an adult and therefore you cannot use your own child as interpreter, if he or she is a minor.
For more information, go to the InfoFinland web page Do you need an interpreter?.
Patient associations
There are many patient associations in Finland that offer information and advice for people with a specific illness.
You can also find peer support through these associations.

If you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus), you have the right to apply for sickness allowance (sairauspäiväraha) from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) after the qualifying period for benefit (omavastuuaika).
The qualifying period for benefit usually starts on the day when you fall ill, and continues for the following 9 weekdays.
If you have been employed at your current job for more than a month before you fell ill, your employer will pay you full salary for the qualifying period for benefit.
Sickness allowance is paid for a maximum of 300 weekdays.
You must apply for it within 2 months of falling ill.
You can apply for sickness allowance if:
you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus); read more on the InfoFinland web page Finnish social security

If you are being paid during the time of your illness, your employer will apply for the sickness allowance.
In this case, the sickness allowance will be paid to your employer. If you are ill for a long time and your employer no longer pays you for the time that you are ill, you can apply for sickness allowance from Kela after your salary payments have ceased.
The amount of sickness allowance paid depends on your income.
It is usually calculated from your taxation on the basis of your confirmed earned income.
Copyright reimbursements and employment options, for example, are not counted when calculating the amount of sickness allowance.
If your income has grown, you can apply for sickness allowance on the basis of the earned income of the last 6 months.
In this case you will need to append to your application a notification of the salary you have received.
You can ask your employer to provide you with this notification.
When you apply for sickness allowance, please attach the following:

However, the services of private doctors are much more expensive for customers.
Infertility
Infertility is often treatable.
Infertility can be due to the man or the woman.
Sometimes, a medical reason cannot be found for it.
If you stopped using contraception but pregnancy has not started after one year, make an appointment at a health centre or a private gynaecologist.
It is a good idea for the couple to go to the clinic together.
The doctor writes a referral for examinations at an infertility clinic.
The examinations determine why pregnancy has not started.
Infertility treatments are offered both by public and private clinics. The right to infertility treatments in public health services depends on, for example, the woman’s age.
Sexually transmitted diseases
If you suspect that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you can make a doctor’s appointment at a health centre or private clinic.
Some cities have an STD clinic where sexually transmitted diseases are treated.
Ask for more information at your health centre.
Using a condom and dental dam will protect you from most sexually transmitted diseases.
Undocumented persons and asylum seeker also have the right to treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.
However, if you are in Finland without a residence permit, you may have to pay for treatment.

Circumcising boys
Consider carefully whether circumcision is necessary.
If the boy is old enough to express his opinion, he must be asked whether he consents to the operation.
The circumcision must not be done if he opposes it.
If the boy has two guardians, both must give written consent for the circumcision.
If there is no medical reason for the circumcision, it cannot be done in public health services.
In that case, you must pay for the operation yourself.
Only doctors can carry out circumcision.
It must be done in sterile conditions.
The doctor must provide pain relief.
You can ask for more information on circumcision from a maternity clinic, a doctor at a health centre, a school nurse or a school doctor.
Female genital mutilation
Female genital mutilation is a crime in Finland.
It can be punished with many years in prison.
It is also a crime to make a girl undergo genital mutilation abroad.
If you have been through female genital mutilation, a surgical opening operation can be done for you.
Corrective surgery is also possible.
Ask for more information at your health centre.

If you fall ill or have an accident, you have the right to stay home from work.
If you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus), you have the right to apply for sickness allowance (sairauspäiväraha) from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) after the qualifying period for benefit (omavastuuaika).
The qualifying period for benefit usually starts on the day when you fall ill, and continues for the following 9 weekdays.
If you have been employed at your current job for more than a month before you fell ill, your employer will pay you full salary for the qualifying period for benefit.
Sickness allowance is paid for a maximum of 300 weekdays.
You must apply for it within 2 months of falling ill.
You can apply for sickness allowance if:
you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus); read more on the InfoFinland web page Finnish social security
you are between 16–67 years old
you are unable to work due to an illness
you have worked for 3 months before falling ill as an employee, entrepreneur or self-employed person or before falling ill, you have studied full-time, been an unemployed job seeker, i.e. a customer of the Employment and Economic Development Office (työ- ja elinkeinotoimisto), or taken sabbatical leave (sapattivapaa) or job alternation leave (vuorotteluvapaa) for 3 months
If you are being paid during the time of your illness, your employer will apply for the sickness allowance. In this case, the sickness allowance will be paid to your employer.
If you are ill for a long time and your employer no longer pays you for the time that you are ill, you can apply for sickness allowance from Kela after your salary payments have ceased.
The amount of sickness allowance paid depends on your income.
It is usually calculated from your taxation on the basis of your confirmed earned income.
Copyright reimbursements and employment options, for example, are not counted when calculating the amount of sickness allowance.
If your income has grown, you can apply for sickness allowance on the basis of the earned income of the last 6 months.
In this case you will need to append to your application a notification of the salary you have received.
You can ask your employer to provide you with this notification.
When you apply for sickness allowance, please attach the following:
a doctor’s certificate of your incapacity for work
salary certificate for the last 6 months if your income has grown

Self-care medication (itsehoitolääke) can be bought without a doctor’s prescription.
For example, most painkillers are regarded as self-care medication.
However, for many medicines you will need a prescription (lääkemääräys) before you can buy them.
Antibiotics, for example, are prescription drugs.
A prescription is written by a doctor.
Also part of the nurses are allowed to prescribe certain medicines.
If you have a long-term illness, take your old prescriptions to the doctor’s surgery, and the doctor will take them into account when writing a new one.
If the doctor gives you an electronic prescription (sähköinen resepti), you can buy your medication at the pharmacy without a printed prescription.
A prescription is valid for two years from the date it was written.
If you have a prescription that you have acquired abroad, it is not valid in Finland.
Prescriptions that have been written in another Nordic country and EU cross-border prescriptions are an exception and are valid in Finland.
You must specifically ask for an EU cross-border prescription from your doctor.
Health care specialists who work in an EU or EEA country or Switzerland and are entitled to prescribe medicines are allowed to issue EU cross-border prescriptions.
The product’s use-by date is indicated on the medicine package.
If the medicine is out-of-date, it should not be used.
Do not throw away old medicines; instead, always take them to the pharmacy (apteekki), because they are hazardous waste.

When to seek help?
Anyone in a challenging situation in life can be in need of help.
Such situations may include, for example, moving to another country, problems at work, losing your job, family problems, divorce, the death of a loved one, illness or some other life change.
A positive event, such as the birth of a child, can also change your life so much that you need support in the new situation.
Sometimes you only start to feel bad afterwards, when some time has passed after the difficult experience and your life has settled.
You should seek help if you have the following symptoms:
insomnia
lack of appetite
your daily life feels depressing
you do not feel like going to work or meeting people
physical symptoms with no medical reasons
your use of alcohol or other intoxicants has increased
It is not rare for people to seek help for their mental health.
In Finland, 20 per cent of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives.
Depression(pdf, 110,37 kt)Finnish _ English _ Russian _ French _ Somali _ Turkish _ Persian _ Arabic _ Kurdish _ Albanian _ Vietnamese _ Burmese _ Bosnian _ Serbian _ Swahili
Where to seek help?
Often it helps just to talk about things with family and friends, but sometimes more help is needed.
Talking to a public health nurse (terveydenhoitaja), doctor (lääkäri) or psychotherapist (psykoterapeutti) may help.
Together you can discuss what kind of support would suit you best.
Therapy, medication or both are often a good remedy.
Sometimes hospital treatment is necessary.
Hospital treatment usually takes some weeks.
The goal is for the patient to be able to return home as soon as possible.
After that, treatment will continue in an out-patient clinic.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, contact your local health centre (terveysasema) first.
Health centres are usually open from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 4 pm.
Call the health centre first thing in the morning and make an appointment.
If you need help quickly, say so on the phone.
When necessary, the doctor will write you a referral to the psychiatric out-patient clinic (psykiatrian poliklinikka) or another mental health unit.
You cannot go directly to an out-patient clinic without a referral from a doctor.
You can talk to a doctor or psychologist in confidence, because they are bound to secrecy.
They will not reveal your affairs to other authorities.
If some other health care unit needs your details, you will be asked for your permission to give them.
Your local health centre will provide you with more accurate information about the way mental health services are organised in your locality.
If you are worried about a family member and you think they might need help, you can ask, for example, a nurse or doctor at a health centre for advice.

Private mental health services
You can also make an appointment at a private clinic for a psychiatrist or psychologist.
It is sometimes possible to get an appointment there faster, but it is considerably more expensive for the customer.
The Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) pays part of the expenses of private health care, if you are covered by Finnish national health insurance.
Ask for more information at Kela.
Sometimes Kela’s reimbursement can be deducted directly from the sum you pay at the cash desk.
Take along the certificate that states that you are covered by the Finnish national health insurance.
You can also apply for reimbursement from Kela afterwards.

When you need help urgently
If you feel that you need help urgently, you can contact your nearest duty health centre or hospital.
The emergency units of psychiatric hospitals offer urgent psychiatric hospital care.
If your family member is a danger to themselves or others and they refuse to see a doctor, you can call a health centre or hospital yourself.
If help is needed fast, say so on the phone.
If you fear that your family member will hurt themselves, mention this too.
If your family member is in very bad condition and needs acute psychiatric hospital care, they may be referred to treatment even if they do not want it themselves.
A doctor’s referral to coercive treatment (pakkohoitolähete) is required for this.
If someone’s life is in immediate danger, you can call the emergency number 112.
Please do not call the emergency number if the situation is non-urgent.

Experiences that cause trauma include:
persecution and discrimination
imprisonment and torture
physical abuse and rape
witnessing violent situations
experiences of war
When suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, the person affected cannot help remembering the trauma in various situations, which causes severe anxiety.
In these cases, it is important to get help.
In addition to the actual victims, posttraumatic stress disorder affects those close to them.
The majority of those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder can be cured with the right treatment.
The Centre for Torture Survivors in Finland (Kidutettujen kuntoutuskeskus) offers help for refugees and asylum seekers who have been tortured in their home countries.

Genital mutilation and pregnancy
If you have been subjected to genital mutilation, a surgical opening operation can be done for you.
It will ease examinations during pregnancy.
It will also make it easier for you to give birth.
The opening operation can also be performed before you become pregnant, during mid-pregnancy or during childbirth.
The maternity clinic nurse will ask you whether you have been subjected to genital mutilation.
It is very important to tell her about it so that she can refer you to an opening operation.
Childbirth
In Finland, women usually give birth in a hospital.
Ask the maternity clinic which hospital you need to go to give birth.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, childbirth will not cost much.
The other parent of the baby can be present during the birth.
If you want, you can also invite another relative or friend to join you.
Most mothers in Finland give birth the traditional way.
It is usually the safest way.
If this is not possible, the doctor will make a decision about performing a C-section.
If you are afraid of childbirth, mention it at the maternity clinic.
Help can be given for your fear, for example, at the Fear of Childbirth Outpatient Clinic (synnytyspelkopoliklinikka).
After childbirth, you will usually spend a few days at the hospital with the baby.
The other parent or another support person can be with you at the hospital, helping you throughout the day.
If you are giving birth to your first child, the support person can usually also spend the nights at the hospital with you.
When you go to the hospital, bring along some clothes for the baby that are warm enough for the journey home.
If you plan to take your baby home by car, you will need a baby car seat (turvakaukalo).
Interpretation during childbirth
It is not possible to know the exact time of birth in advance.
For this reason, it may be difficult to book an interpreter for the birth.
Some interpreter agencies are on call at weekends, in evenings and at nights.
You can find out more about interpreter services in your municipality at your maternity clinic.
Read more about interpreter services on the InfoFinland page
After the child is born
The page When a child is born in Finland contains important information on practical matters that you need to handle after the child is born.
There is information about, for example, registering the children in the Population Information System, the Finnish Act on Forenames and Surnames and the child’s social security.
Help with the baby
If you feel that you cannot cope alone with the baby, you can practise caring for the baby at a Mother and Child Home.
Ask for more information about the activities at your maternity clinic.
You need a referral from your municipality for the Mother and Child Home.
Even if you have no pain or other symptoms, it is important to take regular dental checkups.
Dental illnesses are easier to treat if discovered before any symptoms occur.
Oral and dental health affect your overall health.
If you have a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland, you are entitled to use public dental care services.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
In case of emergency, you can use municipal services even if you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland or a residence permit for Finland.
The costs may be charged to you afterwards.
In Finland, health services are provided in Finnish and Swedish.
You can usually use English, too.
When you make an appointment with a dentist, ask if you can use an interpreter if you do not speak these languages.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Do you need an interpreter?
When you have made an appointment with a dentist, it is important that you arrive at the dentist in good time.
If you have an appointment but cannot make it, it is very important that you cancel it in good time, normally on the previous day.
If you cannot make your appointment and you have not cancelled it, you will have to pay a fee.

Public dental care services
Municipalities offer dental care at health centres (terveysasema) or dental clinics (hammashoitola).
When you want to make an appointment for dental care, call the dental care appointments desk in your locality.
The need for treatment is usually estimated over the phone.
If there is no urgent need for treatment, you may have to queue for several months.
However, getting dental care must take no longer than six months.
When you need urgent care and want to make an appointment, call the emergency dental clinic’s appointments desk (päivystysajanvaraus).
A severe ache, swelling or accident are reasons for seeking urgent care.
Urgent cases are treated quickly.
In the evenings and at weekends, emergency care is centralised at larger units.
If you live in a small community, you may have to travel to the nearest town for emergency care.
If you need more demanding procedures, such as dental surgery, make an appointment first with a dentist.
The dentist will write you a referral to a specialised dentist, if necessary.
Private dental care services
You can also make an appointment with a private dentist.
Private dental care is more expensive than public care.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, Kela will pay a part of the fee.
Kela will not, however, compensate dental care that is purely cosmetic in nature.
More information is available on the Kela website.

You will be given information about the hospital(s) in your area at the maternity clinic.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, hospital care will be cheaper for you than for those who do not.
Home birth is also possible but it is not included in public health care services and it is not recommended.
This means that parents have to make the arrangements for home birth themselves.
Parents also carry the responsibility for the childbirth.
In most cases, the father accompanies the mother during the birth, but another relative or a friend can also act as a support person.
If you wish, you can also ask for a volunteer support person to accompany you during childbirth.
Volunteer support persons have been trained for the task and are called ‘doulas’.
You can ask about doulas at your maternity clinic.
Most mothers in Finland give birth the traditional way.
In most cases, it is the safest way.
However, if this is not possible due to the baby’s position, for example, the doctor will make a decision about performing a C-section.
If everything is well otherwise, the C-section can be planned beforehand.
Sometimes labour begins normally, but for the sake of the baby’s health, an urgent C-section must be performed.
If you are afraid of childbirth, talk about it with the nurse and doctor at the maternity clinic.
Help can be given for your fear, for example, at the Fear of Childbirth Outpatient Clinic (synnytyspelkopoliklinikka).
Maternity clinics and some maternity hospitals organise family training, which aims at preparing the mother-to-be and the entire family for the coming delivery and caring for the baby.
Family training also gives information on how childbirth begins and when it is time to go to the hospital.
If your amniotic fluid begins to flow or you have continual, frequent and painful contractions, call the hospital and ask if it is time to go.
When you go to the hospital, take along some clothes for the baby that are sufficiently warm for the journey home.
If you intend to take your baby home by car, you will need a baby car seat (turvakaukalo).
Interpretation during childbirth
It may be difficult to get an interpreter for childbirth, because it is hard to know the exact time for it beforehand.
Some interpreter centres are on call, when necessary, during weekends and in the evening and night time and also at short notice.
You can find out more about interpreter services in your municipality at your maternity clinic.
You can also make arrangements with the staff for your spouse or a friend who can speak a language that the staff understand to come with you to interpret during childbirth.
Parents decide whether they want an interpreter.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Do you need an interpreter?
Circumcision and childbirth
If you have had a circumcision (ympärileikkaus) before your arrival in Finland, an opening operation (avausleikkaus) will be performed in connection with childbirth.
The operation can also be carried out during mid-pregnancy.
You should tell the staff at the hospital about your circumcision beforehand so that it can be taken into account during childbirth.

The handbook "We're Having a Baby"(pdf, 1,46 Mt)Finnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Somali
In Finland, it is possible to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages in the following situations:
if childbirth would pose a danger to your health
if you are younger than 17 or older than 40
if you have already given birth to four children
if you are unable to take care of the child due to an illness.
It is sufficient reason for an abortion (abortti) if giving birth to or taking care of the child would be a considerable strain in your life situation.
In practice, one of the following can be considered sufficient reason:
family relations
work situation
housing
A woman has the right to decide herself whether she wants to ask for an abortion.
Her partner can participate in the decision-making, if she wants to take his opinion into account.
If you are a minor and wish to ask for an abortion, you do not need your parents’ permission for it.
Nevertheless, it is often good to talk about it with your parents.
If you choose not to, the health care professionals are under an obligation of secrecy.
Abortion must be performed before the twelfth week of pregnancy.
If there is an extremely strong reason, it can be performed later, but a special permit granted by Valvira, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira) is then required.
Valvira’s permission is also required if the abortion is performed due to the serious illness or impairment of the foetus.
Ask a doctor at your health centre (terveysasema) for more information.
If you wish to terminate a pregnancy, contact the health centre of your own area as soon as possible and make a doctor’s appointment.
You can also make an appointment with a private doctor, but when you make it, make sure that the doctor has a licence granted by Valvira for issuing a statement for the abortion.
If you wish, you can take your partner along to the see the doctor.
The doctor will write you a referral to the hospital where the abortion will be performed.
At the hospital, a nurse and doctor will discuss the matter with you.
Together you will decide on the way that the pregnancy will be terminated.
This is affected by the length of the pregnancy and your own opinion.
Abortion is performed either with medication or by surgery (kaavinta).
Surgery is usually performed under anaesthesia, after which you will have to stay at the hospital for a few hours.
If the abortion is performed with medication, the drugs are dosed every 1-3 days via the vagina, causing the womb to contract and shed its lining together with the foetus.
Be prepared to take some painkillers when the womb begins to contract.
Sometimes, in addition to drugs, surgery is also required.
Two to four weeks after the abortion, you will have a follow-up examination at the health centre.
When making a decision about abortion, you will be supported, for example, by the health centre’s nurse or doctor.
For more information about places where you can get help in a challenging situation in life, go to the InfoFinland web page Mental health.

If your child has a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland, he or she is entitled to public health services.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
If you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus), you can take out an insurance policy for your child, which covers the costs of private health care.
When a child falls ill
A feverish child or one who is otherwise ill cannot be taken to day care.
If a child has a cough or a cold but is otherwise well, he or she can go to day care.
When a child under 10 years of age suddenly falls ill, the child’s mother or father can stay at home to look after him/her.
This type of temporary child care leave can last for up to four days.
The collective bargaining agreement states whether or not salary will be paid for this period.
If a child is ill and needs a doctor or a nurse, contact the health centre (terveysasema) in your municipality or a private clinic.
Health centres are open from Monday to Friday, usually from 8 am to 4 pm.
It is best to call the health centre in the morning as soon as it opens for appointments.
The person making your appointment will evaluate what kind of treatment the child needs.
If a child falls ill during a school day, he or she will be treated at school.
If necessary, the child will be taken to the city’s or municipality’s health centre.
In the evenings and at weekends health centres are closed.
At these times, acute cases and accidents are treated at emergency clinics (päivystys).
If your child’s illness does not require immediate treatment, wait until the health centre opens again.
Emergency services for children and the young are often arranged in a separate unit.
You can also make a doctor’s appointment at a private clinic.
These are also often open in the evenings, and sometimes you can get an appointment faster there.
However, private health services are much more expensive for the customer than public ones.
If you suspect that a child has ingested poison, you can ask the Poison Information Centre (Myrkytystietokeskus) for advice.
The centre’s helpline is available 24 hours a day and its phone number is (09) 471 977.
If a child’s life is in danger or they have an accident, call the emergency number (hätänumero)
112. Ambulances are meant only for serious and urgent situations.
Do not call the emergency number in an ordinary case of illness.

Young children’s health
Child health clinics (lastenneuvola) tend to the health of children under school age.
These clinics monitor and support the physical, mental and social growth and development of young children.
At a child health clinic, children visit either a doctor or a nurse.
Families with a child who is less than one year old are invited to a child health clinic at least nine times.
After the first year, families are invited to a child health clinic at least six times more.
The clinic’s nurse monitors children’s development, vaccinates them and provides information about healthy nutrition.
The nurse also visits a child’s home soon after birth.
The child health clinic services of your own municipality are free-of-charge.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you can use these services in your own municipality.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
Always take the card along when you visit a child health clinic.
The nurse will enter your child’s health information and vaccinations on it.

School-age children’s health
Every school has a doctor and a nurse assigned to it.
The nurse checks the children’s health at school.
The nurse is at the school on certain days of the week.
Pupils can go and see the nurse themselves if they have a problem.
If an accident occurs at school, the child involved will be given first aid.
The website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (Sosiaali- ja terveysministeriö) provides information about school health care.

Vaccinations
In Finland, children are offered the possibility of vaccination (rokotus) against many infectious and contagious diseases.
Vaccinations are given at child health clinics (lastenneuvola) and in schools.
Vaccinations that are a part of a vaccination programme are free of charge to the parents.
Vaccinations are voluntary.
The majority of children in Finland are given the vaccinations included in vaccination programmes.
Tell the nurse which vaccinations your child has been given before coming to Finland.
If you want your child to be given a vaccination that is not in the vaccination programme, make an appointment with a doctor.
The doctor can write a prescription for the vaccination, and the nurse can vaccinate your child.
You must buy the vaccination yourself from a pharmacy.

Circumcising boys
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) is always an irrevocable operation.
If it is performed for a non-medical reason, a boy’s bodily integrity is violated.
A circumcision may only be performed by a qualified doctor.
A written consent from the boy’s guardians is required for the circumcision.
If the child has two guardians, both of them must consent to the operation, or otherwise, it must not be performed.
The boy has the right to refuse the operation.
A circumcision must not be performed without pain relief provided by a doctor, and it must be performed under sterile conditions.
A non-medical circumcision is not covered by publicly funded health care, so it cannot be performed at a public health centre, and it must be paid by the party who is having it performed.
You can ask for more information on circumcision from a maternity clinic, a doctor at a health centre, a school nurse or a school doctor.
Circumcising girls
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) of a girl is a crime in Finland and can lead to several years’ imprisonment.
It is also a crime to take a girl to another country to have a circumcision performed on her.
Circumcision of girls and womenFinnish _ English _ Somali _ Arabic
If you think that you may be pregnant you can take a pregnancy test (raskaustesti).
These tests can be bought, for example, at a pharmacy.
When you are pregnant:
Contact the maternity clinic (äitiysneuvola) in your own municipality.
Have a medical examination before the end of your fourth month of pregnancy.
Give your employer written notification at least two months before you begin your maternity leave.
Maternity clinic
A maternity clinic will provide you with guidance in all matters related to pregnancy, and information about various services offered by the society.
The mother’s and foetus’s health are also monitored at the clinic.
The maternity clinic services of your own municipality are free.
If you have a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland, you can use the services of a maternity clinic in your own municipality.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
Fathers are also welcome at these clinics.
The clinic visits include discussions about the relationship between the father and mother, parenthood and the father’s role and responsibility as a parent.
Maternity clinics also organise antenatal and family classes for expectant mothers and fathers.
Most Finnish fathers and mothers participate in these classes.
When necessary, the clinic nurse can ask an interpreter to be with you at the maternity clinic.
The interpreter must be an adult and therefore you cannot use your own child as an interpreter, if he or she is a minor.
All parents at a maternity clinic are given the handbook ‘We’re having a baby’, which has been produced by the National Institute for Health and Welfare (Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos).
You should have your first medical examination before the end of your fourth month of pregnancy.
The doctor or maternity clinic will then provide you with a certificate confirming your pregnancy.
You will need this when applying for a maternity grant (äitiysavustus) and maternity allowance (äitiysraha) from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela).
Find out more on the InfoFinland web page Support for pregnant women.
The website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (Sosiaali- ja terveysministeriö) provides an outline of maternity and child health clinics in Finland.

On-call public health services
Health centres are closed in the evenings and at weekends.

If your illness does not require immediate treatment, book an appointment at your health station the next time it is open.
Duty doctor services are often provided at a hospital department reserved specifically for it and sometimes, in small localities, in a neighbouring town.
Emergency services for children and the young are often arranged in a separate unit.
Ask for more information at your health centre during opening hours or look for more information on the website of your municipality.

Health care for students
If you come to study in Finland from a country other than a EU member state, EEA member state or Switzerland, you will usually need a comprehensive national health insurance policy from your home country before you can get a residence permit for Finland.
If the estimated duration of your studies is no less than two years, you will usually be granted a municipality of residence in Finland and will thus be covered by municipal health services.
In that case, it is enough that your insurance policy primarily covers medical costs.
If you are unsure whether you have the right to a municipality of residence in Finland, check the matter at a Local Register Office.
You can find more information about municipality of residence on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
The website of the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto) provides additional information about residence permits for studies and national health insurance, which you will need for the permit.

In Finland, it is possible to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages in the following situations:
if childbirth would pose a danger to your health
if you are younger than 17 or older than 40
if you have already given birth to four children
if you are unable to take care of the child due to an illness.
It is sufficient reason for an abortion (abortti) if giving birth to or taking care of the child would be a considerable strain in your life situation.
In practice, one of the following can be considered sufficient reason:
family relations
work situation
housing
A woman has the right to decide herself whether she wants to ask for an abortion.
Her partner can participate in the decision-making, if she wants to take his opinion into account.
If you are a minor and wish to ask for an abortion, you do not need your parents’ permission for it.
Nevertheless, it is often good to talk about it with your parents.
If you choose not to, the health care professionals are under an obligation of secrecy.
Abortion must be performed before the twelfth week of pregnancy.
If there is an extremely strong reason, it can be performed later, but a special permit granted by Valvira, the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira) is then required.
Valvira’s permission is also required if the abortion is performed due to the serious illness or impairment of the foetus.
Ask a doctor at your health centre (terveysasema) for more information.
If you wish to terminate a pregnancy, contact the health centre of your own area as soon as possible and make a doctor’s appointment.
You can also make an appointment with a private doctor, but when you make it, make sure that the doctor has a licence granted by Valvira for issuing a statement for the abortion.
If you wish, you can take your partner along to the see the doctor.
The doctor will write you a referral to the hospital where the abortion will be performed.
At the hospital, a nurse and doctor will discuss the matter with you.
Together you will decide on the way that the pregnancy will be terminated.
This is affected by the length of the pregnancy and your own opinion.
Abortion is performed either with medication or by surgery (kaavinta).
Surgery is usually performed under anaesthesia, after which you will have to stay at the hospital for a few hours.
If the abortion is performed with medication, the drugs are dosed every 1-3 days via the vagina, causing the womb to contract and shed its lining together with the foetus.
Be prepared to take some painkillers when the womb begins to contract.
Sometimes, in addition to drugs, surgery is also required.
Two to four weeks after the abortion, you will have a follow-up examination at the health centre.
When making a decision about abortion, you will be supported, for example, by the health centre’s nurse or doctor.
For more information about places where you can get help in a challenging situation in life, go to the InfoFinland web page Mental health.

When to seek help?
Anyone in a challenging situation in life can be in need of help.
Such situations may include, for example, moving to another country, problems at work, losing your job, family problems, divorce, the death of a loved one, illness or some other life change.
A positive event, such as the birth of a child, can also change your life so much that you need support in the new situation.
Sometimes you only start to feel bad afterwards, when some time has passed after the difficult experience and your life has settled.
You should seek help if you have the following symptoms:
insomnia
lack of appetite
your daily life feels depressing
you do not feel like going to work or meeting people
physical symptoms with no medical reasons
your use of alcohol or other intoxicants has increased
It is not rare for people to seek help for their mental health.
In Finland, 20 per cent of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives.
Depression(pdf, 110,37 kt)Finnish _ English _ Russian _ French _ Somali _ Turkish _ Persian _ Arabic _ Kurdish _ Albanian _ Vietnamese _ Burmese _ Bosnian _ Serbian _ Swahili
Where to seek help?
Often it helps just to talk about things with family and friends, but sometimes more help is needed.
Talking to a public health nurse (terveydenhoitaja), doctor (lääkäri) or psychotherapist (psykoterapeutti) may help.
Together you can discuss what kind of support would suit you best.
Therapy, medication or both are often a good remedy.
Sometimes hospital treatment is necessary.
Hospital treatment usually takes some weeks.
The goal is for the patient to be able to return home as soon as possible.
After that, treatment will continue in an out-patient clinic.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, contact your local health centre (terveysasema) first.
Health centres are usually open from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 4 pm.
Call the health centre first thing in the morning and make an appointment.
If you need help quickly, say so on the phone.
When necessary, the doctor will write you a referral to the psychiatric out-patient clinic (psykiatrian poliklinikka) or another mental health unit.
You cannot go directly to an out-patient clinic without a referral from a doctor.
You can talk to a doctor or psychologist in confidence, because they are bound to secrecy.
They will not reveal your affairs to other authorities.
If some other health care unit needs your details, you will be asked for your permission to give them.
Your local health centre will provide you with more accurate information about the way mental health services are organised in your locality.
If you are worried about a family member and you think they might need help, you can ask, for example, a nurse or doctor at a health centre for advice.

Private mental health services
You can also make an appointment at a private clinic for a psychiatrist or psychologist.
It is sometimes possible to get an appointment there faster, but it is considerably more expensive for the customer.
The Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) pays part of the expenses of private health care, if you are covered by Finnish national health insurance.
Ask for more information at Kela.
Sometimes Kela’s reimbursement can be deducted directly from the sum you pay at the cash desk.
Take along the certificate that states that you are covered by the Finnish national health insurance.
You can also apply for reimbursement from Kela afterwards.
For more information about Finnish national health insurance, go to the InfoFinland web page Finnish social security.

When you need help urgently
If you feel that you need help urgently, you can contact your nearest duty health centre or hospital.
The emergency units of psychiatric hospitals offer urgent psychiatric hospital care.
If your family member is a danger to themselves or others and they refuse to see a doctor, you can call a health centre or hospital yourself.
If help is needed fast, say so on the phone.
If you fear that your family member will hurt themselves, mention this too.
If your family member is in very bad condition and needs acute psychiatric hospital care, they may be referred to treatment even if they do not want it themselves.
A doctor’s referral to coercive treatment (pakkohoitolähete) is required for this.
If someone’s life is in immediate danger, you can call the emergency number 112.
Please do not call the emergency number if the situation is non-urgent.
Help by phone
The Crisis Helpline of the Finnish Association for Mental Health (Suomen Mielenterveysseura) offers help in the form of discussion for those in a crisis situation.

Traumatic experiences
People who have experienced traumatic situations are at risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (traumaperäinen stressihäiriö).
Experiences that cause trauma include:
persecution and discrimination
imprisonment and torture
physical abuse and rape
witnessing violent situations
experiences of war
When suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, the person affected cannot help remembering the trauma in various situations, which causes severe anxiety.
In these cases, it is important to get help.
In addition to the actual victims, posttraumatic stress disorder affects those close to them.
The majority of those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder can be cured with the right treatment.
The Centre for Torture Survivors in Finland (Kidutettujen kuntoutuskeskus) offers help for refugees and asylum seekers who have been tortured in their home countries.
You can contact the centre on weekdays between 8.30 am and 1.30 pm. The phone number is (09) 7750 4584.

The emergency number (hätänumero) in Finland is 112.
Call the emergency number only in genuine emergency situations, when someone’s life, health, property or the environment is in danger.
In an emergency situation, you will be treated even if you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland.
The medical costs can be collected from you afterwards.
Call the emergency number 112, for example, in the following situations:
you have been in a car accident (auto-onnettomuus) or you have witnessed an accident
somebody’s life is in danger (hengenvaara)
you notice that a fire (tulipalo) has started

Please do not call the emergency number for non-urgent matters.
Do not call the emergency number in an ordinary case of illness.

An unnecessary call may cause the arrival of help at a real emergency to be delayed with fatal consequences.
If you misuse the emergency number, it may lead to criminal penalties.
An emergency call is answered by a trained Emergency Response Centre operator.
The operator will help you by asking questions and will assess the need for assistance.
After that, they will alert the appropriate unit(s).
The operator will also give you advice on what to do.
They will not put the call through to the police, for example, so the best thing to do is to answer the questions carefully.
When you call the emergency number, you can speak either Finnish or Swedish.
You can ask if the operator understands English, but this is not guaranteed.
If necessary, the Emergency Response Centre will get help from interpreter services.
The emergency number can be called free of charge from any phone.
No area code is needed.
If you have a mobile phone subscription that is based abroad you can still call the emergency number without an area code.
The emergency number 112 works in all EU countries.
If you have installed the free-of-charge 112 Suomi mobile application on your phone, it might not be necessary to state your location.
The Emergency Response Centre operator will see your location automatically when you make the call through the application.
You can download the application from the app store of your phone.
When you call the emergency number 112:
give your name
describe what has happened
give the municipality and the address as accurately as possible

Pregnancy can also be prevented with spermicides, for example, vaginal contraceptive foam (emätinvaahto) or pessaries (emätinpuikko), but these are not very effective.
Using a condom will protect you from most sexually transmitted diseases.
Condoms can be bought from grocery shops, service stations, kiosks and pharmacies, and they can be bought without prescription.
Some spermicides can also be bought from pharmacies without prescription.
For hormonal contraceptives you will need a prescription from a doctor, for example, from a health centre (terveysasema), or a private gynaecologist.
You can also make an appointment at a family planning clinic (ehkäisyneuvonta) and go alone or together with your partner.
Usually no prescription is needed for emergency contraception.
Contraceptive pills, mini-pills, contraceptive patches and vaginal contraceptive rings can be bought from a pharmacy with a doctor’s prescription.
A copper contraceptive coil or hormone coil is fitted in place by a doctor.
Contraceptive coils are best suited for women who have given birth.
Young persons can also make a doctor’s appointment and get a prescription for contraceptives.
Parents’ permission is not required.
Young persons can talk about contraception with their school nurse, and in some municipalities, the school nurse can give them a starter pack.
If you have problems with contraception or you have forgotten to use it, you can buy an emergency contraception pill (jälkiehkäisypilleri) from a pharmacy.
It must be taken as soon as possible after intercourse, at the latest 72 hours after it.
Persons over 15 years of age can buy a emergency contraception pill without prescription.
Persons under 15 years of age need a doctor’s prescription.

Even if you have no pain or other symptoms, it is important to take regular dental checkups.
Dental illnesses are easier to treat if discovered before any symptoms occur.
Oral and dental health affect your overall health.
If you have a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland, you are entitled to use public dental care services.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
In case of emergency, you can use municipal services even if you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland or a residence permit for Finland.
The costs may be charged to you afterwards.
In Finland, health services are provided in Finnish and Swedish.
You can usually use English, too.
When you make an appointment with a dentist, ask if you can use an interpreter if you do not speak these languages.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Do you need an interpreter?
When you have made an appointment with a dentist, it is important that you arrive at the dentist in good time.
If you have an appointment but cannot make it, it is very important that you cancel it in good time, normally on the previous day.
If you cannot make your appointment and you have not cancelled it, you will have to pay a fee.

Public dental care services
Municipalities offer dental care at health centres (terveysasema) or dental clinics (hammashoitola).
When you want to make an appointment for dental care, call the dental care appointments desk in your locality.
The need for treatment is usually estimated over the phone.
If there is no urgent need for treatment, you may have to queue for several months.
However, getting dental care must take no longer than six months.
When you need urgent care and want to make an appointment, call the emergency dental clinic’s appointments desk (päivystysajanvaraus).
A severe ache, swelling or accident are reasons for seeking urgent care.
Urgent cases are treated quickly.
In the evenings and at weekends, emergency care is centralised at larger units.
If you live in a small community, you may have to travel to the nearest town for emergency care.
If you need more demanding procedures, such as dental surgery, make an appointment first with a dentist.
The dentist will write you a referral to a specialised dentist, if necessary.
Private dental care services
You can also make an appointment with a private dentist.
Private dental care is more expensive than public care.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, Kela will pay a part of the fee.
Kela will not, however, compensate dental care that is purely cosmetic in nature.
More information is available on the Kela website.

Public dental care is free of charge for children under the age of 18.
If you have completed a degree in another country, you may need a decision of recognition of the degree to be able to work or study in Finland.
In most situations, the employer, educational institute or university assesses the qualifications and competence that your foreign diploma or degree has provided.
You need a recognition decision from the Finnish National Agency for Education or another authority if you want to work in a regulated profession or a position that requires a higher education degree at a specific level.

If you want to continue studies in Finland
Universities and educational institutes decide on student admission.
They also decide whether foreign studies and your other competence can be accepted as a part of the degree you complete in Finland.
If you have completed higher education courses abroad and want to continue your studies in Finland, you can get information and guidance from the student services and SIMHE services of higher education institutes.
Institutes of higher education offering SIMHE servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Jobs that do not require specific training
Not all jobs require specific training or degree level according to Finnish law.
For example, a private sector employer usually assesses independently whether a foreign diploma or degree provides sufficient qualifications for the job.
Comparability of higher education degree levels
Public sector (municipal or state) positions usually require a higher education degree at a specific level, such as a master’s degree.
If you have completed a higher education degree abroad, you can apply to the Finnish National Agency for Education for a decision to recognise your degree as comparable to a certain level.
The decision is subject to a charge.
Once your degree level has been recognised as comparable to a Finnish higher education degree, you can apply for jobs that require that level of higher education.

Regulated professions
Some professions are regulated in Finland.
This means that the education and training required for them is specified in law.
Such jobs include, for example, physiotherapist, doctor, dentist, pharmacist, nurse, attorney, auditor, class teacher and chimney sweeper.
The authorities for each sector make decisions on the right to carry out a regulated profession or use the professional title.
For example, in the social and health care sector, the decision is made by Valvira National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, and in the education sector, it is made by the Finnish National Agency for Education.
The decision is subject to a charge.
The website of the Finnish National Agency for Education has a list of regulated professions and the decision-making authorities.

you can apply for the recognition of professional qualifications from the authority responsible for the sector.
If your education and training is very different from the education and training required in Finland, you may have to complete an adjustment period or qualification test.

If you have completed a vocational degree abroad, you can apply to the Finnish National Agency for Education for a statement on your degree.

Translation of documents
If the original language of your certificate is not Finnish, Swedish or English, you usually need an authorised translation of the documents done by an authorised translator.

If you want information or help in matters relating to sexual health, contact your local health centre (terveysasema).
You can ask a nurse (terveydenhoitaja) for advice or make an appointment with a doctor (lääkäri).

Help with having a baby
If you wish to have a child, and you and your partner have not conceived a child within a year after the use of contraceptives has been stopped, the matter can be looked into.
The problem can often be solved.
You can make an appointment for examinations at a health centre (terveysasema), with a gynaecologist, or at a private fertility clinic (lapsettomuusklinikka).
It is a good idea for the couple to go to the clinic together.
The examinations are aimed at finding the reason for infertility.
Sexually transmitted diseases
If you suspect that you have a sexually transmitted disease, you can make a doctor’s appointment either at a health centre or private clinic.
In larger cities, such diseases can be treated at a sexually transmitted disease clinic (sukupuolitautien poliklinikka).
Ask for more information at your health centre.
Chlamydia and gonorrhoea are treated with antibiotics.
Viral diseases, such as herpes and condyloma, cannot be cured with medication, but the symptoms can be alleviated.
The progression of HIV infection can be slowed down with medication.
Medication should be started as early as possible.
Using a condom will protect you from most sexually transmitted diseases.

Circumcising boys
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) is always an irrevocable operation.
If it is performed for a non-medical reason, a boy’s bodily integrity is violated.
A circumcision may only be performed by a qualified doctor.
A written consent from the boy’s guardians is required for the circumcision.
If the child has two guardians, both of them must consent to the operation, or otherwise, it must not be performed.
The boy has the right to refuse the operation.
A circumcision must not be performed without pain relief provided by a doctor, and it must be performed under sterile conditions.
A non-medical circumcision is not covered by publicly funded health care, so it cannot be performed at a public health centre, and it must be paid by the party who is having it performed.
You can ask for more information on circumcision from a maternity clinic, a doctor at a health centre, a school nurse or a school doctor.
Circumcising girls
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) of a girl is a crime in Finland and can lead to several years’ imprisonment.
It is also a crime to take a girl to another country to have a circumcision performed on her.
If you were circumcised before you came to Finland and you are planning a pregnancy, an opening operation (avausleikkaus) can be performed to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth.
The operation is easiest to do before pregnancy, but it can also be performed during mid-pregnancy.
The operation will ease childbirth and examinations during pregnancy.
The operation is performed in hospital, and recovery usually takes 1-2 days.
Circumcision of girls and womenFinnish _ English _ Somali _ Arabic
If your child has a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland, he or she is entitled to public health services.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
If you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus), you can take out an insurance policy for your child, which covers the costs of private health care.
When a child falls ill
A feverish child or one who is otherwise ill cannot be taken to day care.
If a child has a cough or a cold but is otherwise well, he or she can go to day care.
When a child under 10 years of age suddenly falls ill, the child’s mother or father can stay at home to look after him/her.
This type of temporary child care leave can last for up to four days.
The collective bargaining agreement states whether or not salary will be paid for this period.
If a child is ill and needs a doctor or a nurse, contact the health centre (terveysasema) in your municipality or a private clinic.
Health centres are open from Monday to Friday, usually from 8 am to 4 pm.
It is best to call the health centre in the morning as soon as it opens for appointments.
The person making your appointment will evaluate what kind of treatment the child needs.
If a child falls ill during a school day, he or she will be treated at school.
If necessary, the child will be taken to the city’s or municipality’s health centre.
In the evenings and at weekends health centres are closed.
At these times, acute cases and accidents are treated at emergency clinics (päivystys).
If your child’s illness does not require immediate treatment, wait until the health centre opens again.
Emergency services for children and the young are often arranged in a separate unit.
You can also make a doctor’s appointment at a private clinic.
These are also often open in the evenings, and sometimes you can get an appointment faster there.
However, private health services are much more expensive for the customer than public ones.
If you suspect that a child has ingested poison, you can ask the Poison Information Centre (Myrkytystietokeskus) for advice.
The centre’s helpline is available 24 hours a day and its phone number is (09) 471 977.
If a child’s life is in danger or they have an accident, call the emergency number (hätänumero)
112. Ambulances are meant only for serious and urgent situations.
Do not call the emergency number in an ordinary case of illness.

Young children’s health
Child health clinics (lastenneuvola) tend to the health of children under school age.
These clinics monitor and support the physical, mental and social growth and development of young children.
At a child health clinic, children visit either a doctor or a nurse.
Families with a child who is less than one year old are invited to a child health clinic at least nine times.
After the first year, families are invited to a child health clinic at least six times more.
The clinic’s nurse monitors children’s development, vaccinates them and provides information about healthy nutrition.
The nurse also visits a child’s home soon after birth.
The child health clinic services of your own municipality are free-of-charge.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you can use these services in your own municipality.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
Always take the card along when you visit a child health clinic.
The nurse will enter your child’s health information and vaccinations on it.

School-age children’s health
Every school has a doctor and a nurse assigned to it.

The nurse is at the school on certain days of the week.
Pupils can go and see the nurse themselves if they have a problem.
If an accident occurs at school, the child involved will be given first aid.

Vaccinations
In Finland, children are offered the possibility of vaccination (rokotus) against many infectious and contagious diseases.
Vaccinations are given at child health clinics (lastenneuvola) and in schools.
Vaccinations that are a part of a vaccination programme are free of charge to the parents.
Vaccinations are voluntary.
The majority of children in Finland are given the vaccinations included in vaccination programmes.
Tell the nurse which vaccinations your child has been given before coming to Finland.
If you want your child to be given a vaccination that is not in the vaccination programme, make an appointment with a doctor.
The doctor can write a prescription for the vaccination, and the nurse can vaccinate your child.
You must buy the vaccination yourself from a pharmacy.

A child with a serious illness or disability may be granted a disability benefit for persons under 16 years of age (alle 16-vuotiaan vammaistuki) by Kela.
Kela’s benefits are intended for people who are covered by Finnish social security.

Circumcising boys
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) is always an irrevocable operation.
If it is performed for a non-medical reason, a boy’s bodily integrity is violated.
A circumcision may only be performed by a qualified doctor.
A written consent from the boy’s guardians is required for the circumcision.
If the child has two guardians, both of them must consent to the operation, or otherwise, it must not be performed.
The boy has the right to refuse the operation.
A circumcision must not be performed without pain relief provided by a doctor, and it must be performed under sterile conditions.
A non-medical circumcision is not covered by publicly funded health care, so it cannot be performed at a public health centre, and it must be paid by the party who is having it performed.
You can ask for more information on circumcision from a maternity clinic, a doctor at a health centre, a school nurse or a school doctor.
Circumcising girls
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) of a girl is a crime in Finland and can lead to several years’ imprisonment.
It is also a crime to take a girl to another country to have a circumcision performed on her.

Housing, working and insurance
It may be difficult to obtain housing as the demand for dwellings exceeds the supply in larger cities in particular.
You should find housing well before moving to Finland.
You can rent a dwelling on the open market.
You can also look for housing through the Finnish Student Housing Association (Suomen Opiskelija-asunnot, SOA).
Housing is expensive in Finland.
Student housing is usually cheaper than housing available on the open market.
If you work alongside your studies, your working hours are limited.
Usually, you can work a maximum of 25 hours a week.
However, this depends on your country of origin.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Student.
You can also complete your thesis in a company or take part in practical training.
In these contexts, the working hours are not limited.
Ensure that you have the appropriate insurance.
The scope of the insurance depends on your country of origin and the duration of your studies.
It is extremely important that you maintain the validity of the insurance for the entire duration of your stay in Finland.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Student.
Studying in Finland
If you are not a citizen of a EU member state or EEA member state, or a family member of a citizen of these countries, and you come to study in Finland in August 2017 or later, you must pay a tuition for your studies.
The tuition applies to higher education degrees in English both at the Bachelor’s and Master’s level.
In Finland, you can study in Finnish, Swedish and, in some cases, in English.
Institutes of higher education include courses in English in some of their study programmes.
However, the majority of education is provided in Finnish or Swedish.
Finland has many active student associations.
They also organise activities for foreign students.
In student associations, you can meet new people.
If you would like to find a job in Finland, study the Finnish or Swedish language.
Even though English is sufficient in many day-to-day situations, most employers require proficiency in Finnish or Swedish.

If you cannot study the Finnish language at your own school, many educational institutes provide Finnish language courses.
You can also study Finnish online.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Finnish and Swedish language.
It is also important to familiarise yourself with Finnish people and working life during your studies.
This will help you to make friends and find employment.
Practical training (työharjoittelu), hobbies and organisations, for example, are a good way to get to know Finnish society.

When to seek help?
Anyone in a challenging situation in life can be in need of help.
Such situations may include, for example, moving to another country, problems at work, losing your job, family problems, divorce, the death of a loved one, illness or some other life change.
A positive event, such as the birth of a child, can also change your life so much that you need support in the new situation.
Sometimes you only start to feel bad afterwards, when some time has passed after the difficult experience and your life has settled.
You should seek help if you have the following symptoms:
insomnia
lack of appetite
your daily life feels depressing
you do not feel like going to work or meeting people
physical symptoms with no medical reasons
your use of alcohol or other intoxicants has increased
It is not rare for people to seek help for their mental health.
In Finland, 20 per cent of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives.
Depression(pdf, 110,37 kt)Finnish _ English _ Russian _ French _ Somali _ Turkish _ Persian _ Arabic _ Kurdish _ Albanian _ Vietnamese _ Burmese _ Bosnian _ Serbian _ Swahili
Where to seek help?
Often it helps just to talk about things with family and friends, but sometimes more help is needed.
Talking to a public health nurse (terveydenhoitaja), doctor (lääkäri) or psychotherapist (psykoterapeutti) may help.
Together you can discuss what kind of support would suit you best.
Therapy, medication or both are often a good remedy.
Sometimes hospital treatment is necessary.
Hospital treatment usually takes some weeks.
The goal is for the patient to be able to return home as soon as possible.
After that, treatment will continue in an out-patient clinic.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, contact your local health centre (terveysasema) first.
Health centres are usually open from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 4 pm.
Call the health centre first thing in the morning and make an appointment.
If you need help quickly, say so on the phone.
When necessary, the doctor will write you a referral to the psychiatric out-patient clinic (psykiatrian poliklinikka) or another mental health unit.
You cannot go directly to an out-patient clinic without a referral from a doctor.
You can talk to a doctor or psychologist in confidence, because they are bound to secrecy.
They will not reveal your affairs to other authorities.
If some other health care unit needs your details, you will be asked for your permission to give them.
Your local health centre will provide you with more accurate information about the way mental health services are organised in your locality.
If you are worried about a family member and you think they might need help, you can ask, for example, a nurse or doctor at a health centre for advice.

Mental health servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian
Private mental health services
You can also make an appointment at a private clinic for a psychiatrist or psychologist.
It is sometimes possible to get an appointment there faster, but it is considerably more expensive for the customer.
The Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) pays part of the expenses of private health care, if you are covered by Finnish national health insurance.
Ask for more information at Kela.
Sometimes Kela’s reimbursement can be deducted directly from the sum you pay at the cash desk.
Take along the certificate that states that you are covered by the Finnish national health insurance.
You can also apply for reimbursement from Kela afterwards.
For more information about Finnish national health insurance, go to the InfoFinland web page Finnish social security.

When you need help urgently
If you feel that you need help urgently, you can contact your nearest duty health centre or hospital.
The emergency units of psychiatric hospitals offer urgent psychiatric hospital care.
If your family member is a danger to themselves or others and they refuse to see a doctor, you can call a health centre or hospital yourself.
If help is needed fast, say so on the phone.
If you fear that your family member will hurt themselves, mention this too.
If your family member is in very bad condition and needs acute psychiatric hospital care, they may be referred to treatment even if they do not want it themselves.
A doctor’s referral to coercive treatment (pakkohoitolähete) is required for this.
If someone’s life is in immediate danger, you can call the emergency number 112.
Please do not call the emergency number if the situation is non-urgent.
Help by phone
The Crisis Helpline of the Finnish Association for Mental Health (Suomen Mielenterveysseura) offers help in the form of discussion for those in a crisis situation.
You can also call the Crisis Helpline if you are worried about a family member.
You can call

Children and young people
If your child is in a situation where his/her mental health is under strain, you can contact your local Family Advice Centre (perheneuvola)
There your child’s situation will be charted so that he/she can be given exactly the kind of help needed.
You can also make an appointment with a psychologist at a child health clinic (lastenneuvola) or a doctor at your local health centre.
If your child is of school age, you can contact the school psychologist or school doctor.
For more information about the kind of help provided for children in problem situations, go to the InfoFinland web page Where to find help for children's and young people's problems?
If you are a young person, you can talk about your difficult issues, for example, with your school nurse, school doctor, school psychologist or school welfare officer.

In occupational health care there may also be a possibility to see a psychologist.
Traumatic experiences
People who have experienced traumatic situations are at risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (traumaperäinen stressihäiriö).
Experiences that cause trauma include:
persecution and discrimination
imprisonment and torture
physical abuse and rape
witnessing violent situations
experiences of war
When suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, the person affected cannot help remembering the trauma in various situations, which causes severe anxiety.
In these cases, it is important to get help.
In addition to the actual victims, posttraumatic stress disorder affects those close to them.
The majority of those suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder can be cured with the right treatment.
The Centre for Torture Survivors in Finland (Kidutettujen kuntoutuskeskus) offers help for refugees and asylum seekers who have been tortured in their home countries.
You can contact the centre on weekdays between 8.30 am and 1.30 pm. The phone number is (09) 7750 4584.

What health services can you use?
You are entitled to use public health services in Finland if you have a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland.
The right to a municipality of residence depends on the following matters:
the country from which you have come to Finland
your reason for coming to Finland (e.g. work, studying)
whether you are moving to Finland permanently or staying here temporarily
if you are staying in Finland temporarily, the length of your stay in Finland
If you are unsure whether you have a municipality of residence in Finland, find out at the Local Register Office (maistraatti).
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
If you come to work in Finland, you may have a right for public health care even if you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland.
If you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland, ask Kela to determine whether you are entitled to public health care.
In an emergency situation, you will be treated in public health care even if you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland or you are not entitled to medical care based on your work.
The medical costs can be collected from you afterwards.
If you are not entitled to public health services, you can make an appointment at a private clinic.
Private health services are considerably more expensive for the customer than public ones.
Health services in Finland are offered in Finnish and Swedish.
Often you can also get along with English.
When making an appointment for health services, ask if it is possible to use an interpreter (tulkki) if you cannot speak any of the above-mentioned languages.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Do you need an interpreter?
When you have made an appointment with a doctor it is important to be there on time.
If you have made an appointment but cannot keep it, it is very important to cancel it in good time, usually the previous day.
If you do not arrive at the clinic and you have not cancelled your appointment, you will be charged a non-attendance fee.

Public health services
If you fall ill, first contact your own health centre (terveysasema) where you can make an appointment with a general practitioner or nurse.
You can find information about the health services of different localities on the InfoFinland websites for different areas or your own municipality’s website.
Health centre services are relatively cheap for clients, because they are funded through tax revenue.
Health centres are usually open from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 4 pm.
To make an appointment, it is a good idea to call the health centre in the morning as soon as it opens.
You will be given an appointment at short notice if you have a condition that requires urgent care.
If you do not need urgent treatment, you will have to wait longer for a doctor’s appointment.
When booking your appointment, you will be told how soon you will receive treatment.
The person making your appointment will also evaluate whether you need to see a doctor or a nurse.
In Finland, nurses can treat a number of illnesses.
If necessary, the nurse will refer you to a doctor.
If you have a Kela card (Kela-kortti), take it along when you go to the health centre.
If you need the services of a specialist, first book an appointment with a general practitioner.
When necessary, a health centre doctor will give you a referral to a specialist.
Some health centres, out-patient clinics and hospitals also have specialists.
Special health care is given at central hospitals and university hospitals.
In Finland, public health service doctors do not make home visits.
Some private clinics offer such services, but a private doctor’s home visit is expensive.
If your illness continues for a long time and you are unable to go to work, you can find more information about Kela’s sickness allowance on the InfoFinland web page Support during illness.
On-call public health services
Health centres are closed in the evenings and at weekends.
At these times, acute cases are treated at emergency clinics (päivystys).
Emergency clinics are intended for situations in which the patient requires immediate treatment.
If your illness does not require immediate treatment, book an appointment at your health station the next time it is open.
Duty doctor services are often provided at a hospital department reserved specifically for it and sometimes, in small localities, in a neighbouring town.
Emergency services for children and the young are often arranged in a separate unit.
Ask for more information at your health centre during opening hours or look for more information on the website of your municipality.
Private health services
The contact information for private clinics can be found online, for example.
It will probably be faster to get an appointment with a private clinic than public health services.
Private health services are considerably more expensive for the client than public ones.
Different clinics offer different services.
Private health services can be used by everyone, including those who do not have a municipality of residence in Finland.
Kela pays a small part of the expenses of private health care and dental care if you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus).
Sometimes a person who is not covered by Finnish national health insurance may also be entitled to Kela reimbursements.
Ask for more information at Kela.
You can also apply for reimbursement from Kela afterwards.

You will receive care under the same terms and pay the same amount for the services as Finns do.
Bring along an official identity card when using health services.

You will pay the same amount for your treatment as permanent Finnish residents do.

Health care for employees and entrepreneurs
If you have come to Finland to work, you may be entitled to use public health services in Finland.
This depends on the duration and type of your contract of employment, as well as on the country from which you have come to Finland.
In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
Entrepreneurs can organise occupational health care for themselves, if they wish.
In other words, entrepreneurs are not under an obligation to arrange occupational health care for themselves.
An entrepreneur is, however, required to organise occupational health care for any employees working for them.
Occupational health care can be arranged at a local health centre or, for example, private clinic.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Occupational health care and on the website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Health care for students
If you come to study in Finland from a country other than a EU member state, EEA member state or Switzerland, you will usually need a comprehensive national health insurance policy from your home country before you can get a residence permit for Finland.
If the estimated duration of your studies is no less than two years, you will usually be granted a municipality of residence in Finland and will thus be covered by municipal health services.
In that case, it is enough that your insurance policy primarily covers medical costs.
If you are unsure whether you have the right to a municipality of residence in Finland, check the matter at a Local Register Office.
You can find more information about municipality of residence on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
The website of the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto) provides additional information about residence permits for studies and national health insurance, which you will need for the permit.
In Finland, students in higher education are covered by the student health care system.
Ask for more information at your educational establishment.
To find out more about student health care, go to the websites of FSHS (YTHS) and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (Sosiaali- ja terveysministeriö).

Public dental care services
Municipalities offer dental care at health centres (terveysasema) or dental clinics (hammashoitola).
When you want to make an appointment for dental care, call the dental care appointments desk in your locality.
The need for treatment is usually estimated over the phone.
If there is no urgent need for treatment, you may have to queue for several months.
However, getting dental care must take no longer than six months.
When you need urgent care and want to make an appointment, call the emergency dental clinic’s appointments desk (päivystysajanvaraus).
A severe ache, swelling or accident are reasons for seeking urgent care.
Urgent cases are treated quickly.
In the evenings and at weekends, emergency care is centralised at larger units.
If you live in a small community, you may have to travel to the nearest town for emergency care.
If you need more demanding procedures, such as dental surgery, make an appointment first with a dentist.
The dentist will write you a referral to a specialised dentist, if necessary.
Private dental care services
You can also make an appointment with a private dentist.
Private dental care is more expensive than public care.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, Kela will pay a part of the fee.
Kela will not, however, compensate dental care that is purely cosmetic in nature.

The operator will help you by asking questions and will assess the need for assistance.
After that, they will alert the appropriate unit(s).

If you have completed a degree in another country, you may need a decision of recognition of the degree to be able to work or study in Finland.
In most situations, the employer, educational institute or university assesses the qualifications and competence that your foreign diploma or degree has provided.
You need a recognition decision from the Finnish National Agency for Education or another authority if you want to work in a regulated profession or a position that requires a higher education degree at a specific level.

If you want to continue studies in Finland
Universities and educational institutes decide on student admission.
They also decide whether foreign studies and your other competence can be accepted as a part of the degree you complete in Finland.
If you have completed higher education courses abroad and want to continue your studies in Finland, you can get information and guidance from the student services and SIMHE services of higher education institutes.

Jobs that do not require specific training
Not all jobs require specific training or degree level according to Finnish law.
For example, a private sector employer usually assesses independently whether a foreign diploma or degree provides sufficient qualifications for the job.
Comparability of higher education degree levels
Public sector (municipal or state) positions usually require a higher education degree at a specific level, such as a master’s degree.
If you have completed a higher education degree abroad, you can apply to the Finnish National Agency for Education for a decision to recognise your degree as comparable to a certain level.
The decision is subject to a charge.
Once your degree level has been recognised as comparable to a Finnish higher education degree, you can apply for jobs that require that level of higher education.

Regulated professions
Some professions are regulated in Finland.
This means that the education and training required for them is specified in law.
Such jobs include, for example, physiotherapist, doctor, dentist, pharmacist, nurse, attorney, auditor, class teacher and chimney sweeper.
The authorities for each sector make decisions on the right to carry out a regulated profession or use the professional title.
For example, in the social and health care sector, the decision is made by Valvira National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, and in the education sector, it is made by the Finnish National Agency for Education.
The decision is subject to a charge.
The website of the Finnish National Agency for Education has a list of regulated professions and the decision-making authorities.

When a child falls ill
A feverish child or one who is otherwise ill cannot be taken to day care.
If a child has a cough or a cold but is otherwise well, he or she can go to day care.
When a child under 10 years of age suddenly falls ill, the child’s mother or father can stay at home to look after him/her.
This type of temporary child care leave can last for up to four days.
The collective bargaining agreement states whether or not salary will be paid for this period.
If a child is ill and needs a doctor or a nurse, contact the health centre (terveysasema) in your municipality or a private clinic.
Health centres are open from Monday to Friday, usually from 8 am to 4 pm.
It is best to call the health centre in the morning as soon as it opens for appointments.
The person making your appointment will evaluate what kind of treatment the child needs.
If a child falls ill during a school day, he or she will be treated at school.
If necessary, the child will be taken to the city’s or municipality’s health centre.
In the evenings and at weekends health centres are closed.
At these times, acute cases and accidents are treated at emergency clinics (päivystys).
If your child’s illness does not require immediate treatment, wait until the health centre opens again.
Emergency services for children and the young are often arranged in a separate unit.
You can also make a doctor’s appointment at a private clinic.
These are also often open in the evenings, and sometimes you can get an appointment faster there.
However, private health services are much more expensive for the customer than public ones.
If you suspect that a child has ingested poison, you can ask the Poison Information Centre (Myrkytystietokeskus) for advice.

Young children’s health
Child health clinics (lastenneuvola) tend to the health of children under school age.
These clinics monitor and support the physical, mental and social growth and development of young children.
At a child health clinic, children visit either a doctor or a nurse.
Families with a child who is less than one year old are invited to a child health clinic at least nine times.
After the first year, families are invited to a child health clinic at least six times more.
The clinic’s nurse monitors children’s development, vaccinates them and provides information about healthy nutrition.
The nurse also visits a child’s home soon after birth.
The child health clinic services of your own municipality are free-of-charge.
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you can use these services in your own municipality.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
Always take the card along when you visit a child health clinic.

Vaccinations are voluntary.
The majority of children in Finland are given the vaccinations included in vaccination programmes.

Circumcising boys
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) is always an irrevocable operation.
If it is performed for a non-medical reason, a boy’s bodily integrity is violated.
A circumcision may only be performed by a qualified doctor.
A written consent from the boy’s guardians is required for the circumcision.
If the child has two guardians, both of them must consent to the operation, or otherwise, it must not be performed.
The boy has the right to refuse the operation.
A circumcision must not be performed without pain relief provided by a doctor, and it must be performed under sterile conditions.
A non-medical circumcision is not covered by publicly funded health care, so it cannot be performed at a public health centre, and it must be paid by the party who is having it performed.
You can ask for more information on circumcision from a maternity clinic, a doctor at a health centre, a school nurse or a school doctor.
Circumcising girls
A circumcision (ympärileikkaus) of a girl is a crime in Finland and can lead to several years’ imprisonment.
It is also a crime to take a girl to another country to have a circumcision performed on her.

It may be difficult to obtain housing as the demand for dwellings exceeds the supply in larger cities in particular.
You should find housing well before moving to Finland.
You can rent a dwelling on the open market.
You can also look for housing through the Finnish Student Housing Association (Suomen Opiskelija-asunnot, SOA).
Housing is expensive in Finland.
Student housing is usually cheaper than housing available on the open market.
If you work alongside your studies, your working hours are limited.
Usually, you can work a maximum of 25 hours a week.
However, this depends on your country of origin.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Student.
You can also complete your thesis in a company or take part in practical training.
In these contexts, the working hours are not limited.
Ensure that you have the appropriate insurance.
The scope of the insurance depends on your country of origin and the duration of your studies.
It is extremely important that you maintain the validity of the insurance for the entire duration of your stay in Finland.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Student.
Studying in Finland
If you are not a citizen of a EU member state or EEA member state, or a family member of a citizen of these countries, and you come to study in Finland in August 2017 or later, you must pay a tuition for your studies.
The tuition applies to higher education degrees in English both at the Bachelor’s and Master’s level.
In Finland, you can study in Finnish, Swedish and, in some cases, in English.
Institutes of higher education include courses in English in some of their study programmes.
However, the majority of education is provided in Finnish or Swedish.
Finland has many active student associations.
They also organise activities for foreign students.
In student associations, you can meet new people.
If you would like to find a job in Finland, study the Finnish or Swedish language.
Even though English is sufficient in many day-to-day situations, most employers require proficiency in Finnish or Swedish.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Finnish and Swedish language.
If you cannot study the Finnish language at your own school, many educational institutes provide Finnish language courses.
You can also study Finnish online.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Finnish and Swedish language.
It is also important to familiarise yourself with Finnish people and working life during your studies.
This will help you to make friends and find employment.
Practical training (työharjoittelu), hobbies and organisations, for example, are a good way to get to know Finnish society.

What health services can you use?
You are entitled to use public health services in Finland if you have a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland.
The right to a municipality of residence depends on the following matters:
the country from which you have come to Finland
your reason for coming to Finland (e.g. work, studying)
whether you are moving to Finland permanently or staying here temporarily
if you are staying in Finland temporarily, the length of your stay in Finland
If you are unsure whether you have a municipality of residence in Finland, find out at the Local Register Office (maistraatti).
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
If you come to work in Finland, you may have a right for public health care even if you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland.
If you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland, ask Kela to determine whether you are entitled to public health care.
In an emergency situation, you will be treated in public health care even if you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland or you are not entitled to medical care based on your work.
The medical costs can be collected from you afterwards.
If you are not entitled to public health services, you can make an appointment at a private clinic.
Private health services are considerably more expensive for the customer than public ones.
Health services in Finland are offered in Finnish and Swedish.
Often you can also get along with English.
When making an appointment for health services, ask if it is possible to use an interpreter (tulkki) if you cannot speak any of the above-mentioned languages.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Do you need an interpreter?
When you have made an appointment with a doctor it is important to be there on time.
If you have made an appointment but cannot keep it, it is very important to cancel it in good time, usually the previous day.
If you do not arrive at the clinic and you have not cancelled your appointment, you will be charged a non-attendance fee.

Public health services
If you fall ill, first contact your own health centre (terveysasema) where you can make an appointment with a general practitioner or nurse.
You can find information about the health services of different localities on the InfoFinland websites for different areas or your own municipality’s website.
Health centre services are relatively cheap for clients, because they are funded through tax revenue.
Health centres are usually open from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 4 pm.
To make an appointment, it is a good idea to call the health centre in the morning as soon as it opens.
You will be given an appointment at short notice if you have a condition that requires urgent care.
If you do not need urgent treatment, you will have to wait longer for a doctor’s appointment.
When booking your appointment, you will be told how soon you will receive treatment.
The person making your appointment will also evaluate whether you need to see a doctor or a nurse.
In Finland, nurses can treat a number of illnesses.
If necessary, the nurse will refer you to a doctor.
If you have a Kela card (Kela-kortti), take it along when you go to the health centre.
If you need the services of a specialist, first book an appointment with a general practitioner.
When necessary, a health centre doctor will give you a referral to a specialist.
Some health centres, out-patient clinics and hospitals also have specialists.
Special health care is given at central hospitals and university hospitals.
In Finland, public health service doctors do not make home visits.
Some private clinics offer such services, but a private doctor’s home visit is expensive.
If your illness continues for a long time and you are unable to go to work, you can find more information about Kela’s sickness allowance on the InfoFinland web page Support during illness.
On-call public health services
Health centres are closed in the evenings and at weekends.
At these times, acute cases are treated at emergency clinics (päivystys).
Emergency clinics are intended for situations in which the patient requires immediate treatment.
If your illness does not require immediate treatment, book an appointment at your health station the next time it is open.
Duty doctor services are often provided at a hospital department reserved specifically for it and sometimes, in small localities, in a neighbouring town.
Emergency services for children and the young are often arranged in a separate unit.
Ask for more information at your health centre during opening hours or look for more information on the website of your municipality.
Private health services
The contact information for private clinics can be found online, for example.
It will probably be faster to get an appointment with a private clinic than public health services.
Private health services are considerably more expensive for the client than public ones.
Different clinics offer different services.
Private health services can be used by everyone, including those who do not have a municipality of residence in Finland.
Kela pays a small part of the expenses of private health care and dental care if you are covered by Finnish national health insurance (sairausvakuutus).
Sometimes a person who is not covered by Finnish national health insurance may also be entitled to Kela reimbursements.
Sometimes
Kela’s reimbursement can be deducted directly from the sum you pay at the cash desk.
You can also apply for reimbursement from Kela afterwards.
For more information about the Finnish national health insurance, go to the InfoFinland web page Finnish social security.

Health care for Nordic citizens
If you are covered by health insurance in another Nordic country, you are entitled to essential health care in Finland.
You will receive care under the same terms and pay the same amount for the services as Finns do.
Bring along an official identity card when using health services.
Health care for EU citizens
If you are covered by health insurance in another EU member state, EEA member state or Switzerland, you are entitled to essential health care in Finland.
In order to receive treatment, you must have a European Health Insurance Card.
You must obtain a European Health Insurance Card from the country in which you are covered by health insurance.
The European Health Insurance card entitles you to receive treatment if you fall ill or have an accident.
You will also receive treatment if your long-term illness requires it.
The card also entitles you to receive treatment related to pregnancy and delivery.
You will pay the same amount for your treatment as permanent Finnish residents do.
Information on the European Health Insurance CardFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Health care for employees and entrepreneurs
If you have come to Finland to work, you may be entitled to use public health services in Finland.
This depends on the duration and type of your contract of employment, as well as on the country from which you have come to Finland.
In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
Entrepreneurs can organise occupational health care for themselves, if they wish.
In other words, entrepreneurs are not under an obligation to arrange occupational health care for themselves.
An entrepreneur is, however, required to organise occupational health care for any employees working for them.
Occupational health care can be arranged at a local health centre or, for example, private clinic.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Occupational health care and on the website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Health care for students
If you come to study in Finland from a country other than a EU member state, EEA member state or Switzerland, you will usually need a comprehensive national health insurance policy from your home country before you can get a residence permit for Finland.
If the estimated duration of your studies is no less than two years, you will usually be granted a municipality of residence in Finland and will thus be covered by municipal health services.
In that case, it is enough that your insurance policy primarily covers medical costs.
If you are unsure whether you have the right to a municipality of residence in Finland, check the matter at a Local Register Office.
You can find more information about municipality of residence on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
The website of the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto) provides additional information about residence permits for studies and national health insurance, which you will need for the permit.
In Finland, students in higher education are covered by the student health care system.
Ask for more information at your educational establishment.
To find out more about student health care, go to the websites of FSHS (YTHS) and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (Sosiaali- ja terveysministeriö).

Health care for refugees and asylum seekers
If you have come to Finland as a quota refugee, you have a municipality of residence in Finland and you are entitled to use public health services.

Ask for more information at your reception centre.
If you have gained a residence permit on the basis of a need for protection and are given the right to a municipality of residence in Finland, you are entitled to use the health services of your own municipality.
You can find more information about the right to a municipality of residence in Finland on the InfoFinland web page Municipality of residence in Finland.
Health care for undocumented migrants
If you are in Finland without a residence permit, you can get medical assistance and advice from the Global Clinic.

Turku
Oulu
Joensuu
Tampere

If you have completed a foreign degree, you might benefit from having the degree compared to a Finnish degree, having your professional qualification recognised, acquiring a right to practice your profession or completing a competence-based qualification.
Equivalence and recognition of degrees
Recognition of a degree is a decision about which qualifications a degree completed in a foreign country gives you to work or apply for a student position in Finland.
Recognition of a degree is subject to a charge and is requested from the Finnish National Board of Education.
When you are applying for a student position, recognition of a degree is not necessarily needed.
Professional recognition and the right to practise a profession
Persons applying for positions in the public sector (the state and municipalities) often need to meet certain educational qualification requirements.
When a person who has completed his or her studies abroad applies for such position, he or she usually needs a decision issued by the Finnish National Board of Education stating that his or her degree qualifies for the position.
The applicants of a position in a regulated profession must hold a certain degree stipulated in legislation or certain studies.
Regulated professions include some public sector jobs and positions that require a right to practise that profession.
The right to practise a profession is required for example in health care and seafaring positions.
If you have a foreign degree in a profession that is regulated in Finland, you need to get an equivalence decision from a competent authority before you can practise your profession in Finland.
The Finnish National Board of Education website contains a list of regulated professions and competent authorities for each of them.
Private sector employers evaluate independently whether they will accept an employee’s foreign degree.
Recognition decisions are not required in the private sector, but they may be useful when applying for a position.
The Finnish National Board of Education also issues expert statements on foreign vocational degrees.
These statements, however, do not grant eligibility for civil service posts. They may, nevertheless, be helpful when looking for a job or a place to study, as they describe the content and level of education received abroad.
Academic recognition
If you wish to continue your studies in Finland, the studies you have completed abroad may be taken into consideration through academic recognition.
Academic recognition of degrees entails
seeking a place of study on the basis of foreign education
Recognition of studies completed abroad towards a degree to be completed in Finland.
Educational institutions make independent decisions on their student selections and also on whether or not they accept studies completed abroad as a part of a Finnish degree.
Ask for more information directly from the institution you would like to study at.

This allows the child to study Finnish or Swedish as a second language, i.e. S2 language (S2-kieli).
A student will study Finnish (or Swedish) as a second language, if his or her Finnish or Swedish skills are not at a native level.
Upper secondary schools for adults organise basic education for adult immigrants who do not have a comprehensive school leaving certificate from their native country.
Ask for more information at the counselling services of your municipality or at the nearest upper secondary school for adults.

Messages between the home and school
In many municipalities, the school uses the Wilma online service to communicate about important matters.
The school gives the child’s parents a username and password for the service.
Through Wilma, you can stay in touch with your child’s teachers and receive information about your child’s learning, exams and absences as well as school events and holidays.
If your child must be absent from school, for example due to illness, inform the school through Wilma that morning.
It is important to monitor Wilma regularly.
If you need help with using Wilma, ask the school for guidance.
The City of Kerava has published instructions in different languages on how to use Wilma.
Please note that the login address for Wilma is different in different cities.

At that point, the child will be approximately nine months old.
If you do not have an official municipality of residence in Finland, you are considered a resident of the municipality in which you reside.
If both parents work, their child has the right to full-time early education.
If one parent is at home, the child’s right to early education depends on their municipality of residence.
In some municipalities, the child may have a right to full-time early education even if one parent is at home.
In other municipalities, the child has a right to 20 hours of early education per week if one parent is at home.
However, the family can apply for a right to full-time early education if the child needs special support with learning Finnish or because of a difficult family situation.
You can apply for a place in
a day care centre (päiväkoti)
At day-care centres, children are in larger groups than in group family day care.
Family day care involves a care provider looking after the children in his or her own home.
Some family day care providers look after children in the children's home.
Apply for a municipal early childhood education place from your municipality at least four months before your child is due to start day care.
A place can be granted within two weeks if the parents get a job or a student position.
The early education fee (varhaiskasvatusmaksu) depends on
the family’s income;
family size; and
how many hours a week your child will attend early childhood education.
A discount is granted for the day care fees of any siblings.
If the family has a very low income, early childhood education may be free of charge.
For further information, contact the advisory services of your own municipality.
Private early childhood education
The different forms of private early childhood education include:
private day care centres or private group family day care centres
family day care providers or
day care given by a child carer hired by the family to work at their home
You can apply for early childhood education directly from a private day-care centre or a private group family day-care centre.
You can also seek a private family day care provider who will look after children in his or her own home, or hire a child carer to work in your home.
If you hire a child carer to work in your home, you become an employer and must attend to an employer’s obligations.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Employer’s rights and obligations.
You can also hire a child carer together with another family.
The municipality supervises private early childhood education.
The costs of private early childhood education vary.
However, you can receive support for it from Kela.
In such a case, private early childhood education does not necessarily cost much more than municipal early childhood education.
Private day care allowance
If your child has a municipality of residence in Finland, you can apply for private day care allowance from Kela.
The child care provider must be approved by the municipality.
You can apply for private day care allowance (yksityisen hoidon tuki) if
your child is under school age and is placed in a private day care centre; or
your child is looked after by another type of private day care provider.
You cannot apply for private day care allowance if the care provider is a family member of the child or if the child and the carer live in the same household.
Neither can you receive private day care allowance if your child is placed in municipal early childhood education.
The amount of allowance depends on the income of the child's family and on the municipality in which the family resides, among other things.
Kela pays the allowance directly to the hired child carer or other child care provider.
Private day care allowance is taxable income.
This allowance is not paid abroad.
Further information on private day care allowance is available on Kela’s website.
Kela offers a telephone service for families with children.
in Finnish, Tel. +358 (0)20 692 206
for calls in Swedish and English tel. +358 (0)20 692 226
Kela offices also provide services in other languages via interpreters.

Your family’s religious convictions or life philosophies will be taken into consideration in early childhood education.
Some localities provide day care centres in which children and teachers speak a language other than Finnish or Swedish.
Days in early childhood education normally begin in the morning and end in the afternoon.
However, some day-care centres and family day care providers are open around the clock due to the parents' studies or working hours.

Fire safety
A smoke detector can save your life.
If a fire breaks out in your home, a smoke detector emits a loud alarm sound so that you can evacuate the premises in time.
Ensure that your home is equipped with a sufficient number of smoke detectors.
Smoke detectors are sold in department stores and hardware shops.
One smoke detector can cover up to 60 square metres.
For example, if your home is 65 square metres in size, you will need two smoke detectors.
If your home has more than one floor, calculate the floor area of each floor separately.
There must be a smoke detector on every floor.
Check regularly that the smoke detector functions properly.
Replace the batteries, if necessary – preferably once a year.
You are responsible for the smoke detectors even if you are living in a rental dwelling.
Finnish dwellings often have a sauna.
Never place anything above the sauna heater even if you are not using the sauna, as this may cause a fire.
For example, do not dry laundry above the sauna heater or near it.
Always switch off an electric sauna heater after use.
When leaving your home, remember to check that the stove, sauna heater and iron, for example, have been switched off.
It is also a good idea to have a fire extinguisher in your home.
Some blocks of flats also have a fire extinguisher in the stairway.
Find out where the nearest fire extinguisher is located.
Ensure that you have a fire blanket in your home.
It is advisable to keep it near the stove, for example.
Do not leave food on a hot stove unattended.
Be particularly careful when cooking at night.
Do not cook food when intoxicated.
Do not store items on the stove.
Children, pets or inadvertent contact may accidentally switch on the stove.
This may ignite the items on the stove.
If the grease catches fire when you are cooking, smother the flames with the lid of a pot or frying pan, or a fire blanket.
Do not use water.
Remember to switch off electrical devices after use.
An iron must also be disconnected from the power socket.
Do not use electrical devices that are in poor conditions or whose cable is faulty.
If an electrical device catches fire, do not use water.
Put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, for example.
If you have electric radiators or other heaters in your home, do not place fabrics, clothes or any other items on them.

Preventing water damage
Do not leave a washing machine or dishwasher on when leaving the home.
Regularly check the water pipes in your home for leaks and ensure that water does not leak on the floor from any appliances.
Keep the washing machine and dishwasher valves closed when not using the machines.
A plastic leak pan is required under the refrigerator, freezer and dishwasher.
It is installed at the same time as the device.
Do not install a dishwasher yourself – leave it to a professional.
If there is a water leak in your home, try to close off the water line with the shut-off valve.
If you live in a block of flats or terraced house, immediately report leaks to the housing company’s on-call number.
If you live in a detached house, notify an on-call plumbing firm.
Electrical work
The mains voltage in Finland is 230 V.
In Finland, actual electrical work may only be conducted by professional electricians.

Preparatory vocational education (ammatilliseen peruskoulutukseen valmentava koulutus) or VALMA is intended for persons who would like to take a degree programme leading to a vocational upper secondary qualification.
VALMA education provides you with knowledge and skills that will help you later in your vocational studies.
You can also improve your language skills and your comprehensive school grades.
VALMA education takes approximately one school year.
During the education, you will have the opportunity to familiarise yourself with various fields and consider what you would like to study.
You will also visit workplaces and participate in workshops.
At the beginning of the education, an individual study plan will be drawn up for you.
The plan specifies which studies you will take and in which form.
Once completed, you will obtain a certificate of your VALMA education.
When you later apply for upper secondary vocational education through the joint application system, you can get extra points for completed preparatory education.
VALMA education is normally free of charge for students.

Early childhood education is intended for children under school age.
In Finland, municipalities offer municipal early childhood education at day-care centres, for example.
There are also private day-care centres.
Early childhood education is education, teaching and care that have been pedagogically planned, with carefully considered goals.
Trained early education teachers and child nurses work in early education.
Usually, either of the parents looks after the child at home until at least the end of the parental leave, in other words, until the child is around nine months old.
If you also look after your child at home after the period of parental leave, you are entitled to leave from work for childcare purposes until the child’s third birthday.
You can find more information about leave on the InfoFinland page Family leave.
You can apply for financial support for childcare at home from Kela.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
Municipal early childhood education
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you can apply for a place in municipal early childhood education for your child after the period of parental leave.
At that point, the child will be approximately nine months old.
If you do not have an official municipality of residence in Finland, you are considered a resident of the municipality in which you reside.
If both parents work, their child has the right to full-time early education.
If one parent is at home, the child’s right to early education depends on their municipality of residence.
In some municipalities, the child may have a right to full-time early education even if one parent is at home.
In other municipalities, the child has a right to 20 hours of early education per week if one parent is at home.
However, the family can apply for a right to full-time early education if the child needs special support with learning Finnish or because of a difficult family situation.
You can apply for a place in
a day care centre (päiväkoti)
At day-care centres, children are in larger groups than in group family day care.
Family day care involves a care provider looking after the children in his or her own home.
Some family day care providers look after children in the children's home.
Apply for a municipal early childhood education place from your municipality at least four months before your child is due to start day care.
A place can be granted within two weeks if the parents get a job or a student position.
The early education fee (varhaiskasvatusmaksu) depends on
the family’s income;
family size; and
how many hours a week your child will attend early childhood education.
A discount is granted for the day care fees of any siblings.
If the family has a very low income, early childhood education may be free of charge.
For further information, contact the advisory services of your own municipality.
Private early childhood education
The different forms of private early childhood education include:
private day care centres or private group family day care centres
family day care providers or
day care given by a child carer hired by the family to work at their home
You can apply for early childhood education directly from a private day-care centre or a private group family day-care centre.
You can also seek a private family day care provider who will look after children in his or her own home, or hire a child carer to work in your home.
If you hire a child carer to work in your home, you become an employer and must attend to an employer’s obligations.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Employer’s rights and obligations.
You can also hire a child carer together with another family.
The municipality supervises private early childhood education.
The costs of private early childhood education vary.
However, you can receive support for it from Kela.
In such a case, private early childhood education does not necessarily cost much more than municipal early childhood education.
Private day care allowance
If your child has a municipality of residence in Finland, you can apply for private day care allowance from Kela.
The child care provider must be approved by the municipality.
You can apply for private day care allowance (yksityisen hoidon tuki) if
your child is under school age and is placed in a private day care centre; or
your child is looked after by another type of private day care provider.
You cannot apply for private day care allowance if the care provider is a family member of the child or if the child and the carer live in the same household.
Neither can you receive private day care allowance if your child is placed in municipal early childhood education.
The amount of allowance depends on the income of the child's family and on the municipality in which the family resides, among other things.
Kela pays the allowance directly to the hired child carer or other child care provider.
Private day care allowance is taxable income.
This allowance is not paid abroad.
Further information on private day care allowance is available on Kela’s website.
Kela offers a telephone service for families with children.
in Finnish, Tel. +358 (0)20 692 206
for calls in Swedish and English tel. +358 (0)20 692 226
Kela offices also provide services in other languages via interpreters.

What takes place in early childhood education?
Early childhood education includes a range of activities, for example games, sports, music, crafts and excursions.
Children can also take a nap or rest during the day.
The goal of these activities is to further the development of and learning among children.
Children also learn social skills.
The child is supported in learning Finnish or Swedish if he or she has another mother tongue.
The child may also receive special needs education, if necessary.
However, the day care centre is not a school.
Children do not study subjects or attend classes.
During the day, the children eat three meals: breakfast, lunch and a snack.
If your child has a special diet, please inform the early childhood education teachers.
Your family’s religious convictions or life philosophies will be taken into consideration in early childhood education.
Some localities provide day care centres in which children and teachers speak a language other than Finnish or Swedish.
Days in early childhood education normally begin in the morning and end in the afternoon.
However, some day-care centres and family day care providers are open around the clock due to the parents' studies or working hours.

Looking for a dwelling
I cannot find an affordable rental dwelling.
There are not many rental dwellings available in the largest cities.
Dwellings are more expensive near the city centre.
Therefore, many Finns live in quite small dwellings.
Many also live far from the city centre or in some other adjacent municipality so they have a longer commute to work.
If you cannot find an affordable dwelling in the area you like, consider the possibility of living in a smaller dwelling or further away from the city centre.
Many smaller cities have plenty of available dwellings and the prices are more affordable.
If you are planning to move from a small town to a large city, look for a dwelling in advance.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
I submitted an application for a municipal rental dwelling, but I have not received one even though much time has elapsed.
The number of municipal dwellings does not allow their allocation to all applicants.
It is recommended to apply for a dwelling from many different places.
Also keep an eye on the supply of private rental dwellings.
Remember to update your application while it is still valid, otherwise the application will expire.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
I suspect that I have been discriminated against when I have looked for a dwelling.
From where can I get help?
According to the law, lessors are not allowed to discriminate against anybody, for example due to ethnic origin, religion or nationality, when selecting tenants.
A private lessor, however, is entitled to select the tenant of the dwelling without any need to justify the selection.
If you suspect that you have been discriminated against, you can ask for advice, for example, from the customer service of the Non-Discrimination Ombudsman.
Customer service of the Non-Discrimination OmbudsmanFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Renting a dwelling
Do I have to pay a commission to the agent when I rent a dwelling?
The commission is usually paid by the lessor.
You yourself have to pay the commission only in the case where you have concluded in advance a written commission agreement with the agent.
If you have not concluded a written commission agreement, the agent is not entitled to demand commission from you.
If he/she tries to do so, you can file a notice of a crime.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Crimes.
The agent demands a payment for seeing the dwelling.
Do I have to pay?
You are entitled to see the dwelling in advance and the agent cannot demand payment for it.
If you have problems regarding the commission, you can contact the Consumer Advisory Service.
linkkiFinnish Competition and Consumer Authority:
Consumer consultingFinnish _ Swedish _ English
The agent demands that I pay a reservation fee on the rental dwelling.
Do I have to pay?
There is no such thing as a dwelling reservation fee in Finland.
Do not pay anything until you have a written tenancy agreement on the dwelling.
Read more about the rental dwelling fees, such as the rental security deposit, on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
The lessor requires that I take home insurance.
Where can I take out home insurance?
Can I cancel it later?
Home insurance is sold by many insurance companies in Finland.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Everyday life in Finland.
It is recommended to take out home insurance, even if it is not required in the tenancy agreement.
You are not recommended to cancel the home insurance while you live in the dwelling.
If, for example, you cause water damage and you do not have a home insurance, you have to pay all the repair costs yourself.
The total amount can be tens of thousands of euros.
What should I take into account before signing a tenancy agreement?
Take a good look at the dwelling before renting it.
Check that the dwelling actually exists, i.e. the address of the dwelling matches the one indicated on the agreement.
Also ensure that the dwelling is in the condition described to you.
Check from the tenancy agreement, for example, the terms and conditions of the tenancy and the period of notice.
You are also recommended to go over the dwelling and its possible defects with the owner or his/her representative.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
When does the rental security deposit have to be paid?
Do not pay the rental security deposit, until you have a written tenancy agreement.
The lessor can assign a bank account for paying the rental security deposit.
You can also open a separate account for the rental security deposit at a bank.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
The lessor suggested that we could conclude an oral tenancy agreement.
Is an oral agreement sufficient?
Always conclude the tenancy agreement in writing.
This way you can prove what you have agreed in case of problems.
Keep the tenancy agreement in a safe place.
There are a few defects in the rental dwelling.
Can the lessor demand afterwards that I should compensate for the defects that I have not caused?
You are recommended to write down the defects of the dwelling together with the lessor at the beginning of the tenancy.
You can also take photos of the defects.
This way you can ensure that you will not be held responsible for the defects you did not cause.
Giving notice
I gave notice on my rental dwelling, but the lessor demands that I pay rent until he/she can find a new tenant.
Do I have to pay?
If you have a non-fixed-term tenancy agreement, the period of notice is usually one calendar month.
The period begins from the end of the month you gave notice in.
Once the period of notice has expired, the lessor cannot demand rent from you.
You cannot give notice when a fixed-term tenancy agreement is valid.
If necessary, you can try to negotiate an earlier termination of the tenancy agreement.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
I have a non-fixed-term tenancy agreement.
I gave notice on 2 June.
The lessor demands that I also pay rent in July.
Do I have to pay?
If your tenancy agreement does not state otherwise, the period of notice is calculated according to the law from the end of the calendar month you give notice in.
If you give notice on 2 June, the period of notice will begin on 30 June and last for one month.
Therefore, you must pay rent for July.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
Loss of dwelling
I do not have money to pay rent.
What can I do?
Contact your lessor as soon as possible and try to negotiate more time.
Determine whether you can postpone other payments in order to be able to pay your rent.
Also, contact your bank and find out whether your bank can grant you a loan so that you are able to pay your rent.
Find out from KELA whether you are entitled to receive housing allowance or some other allowance.
You can also ask for advice and help from the municipal debt counselling, social welfare office or a housing counsellor of the municipality, tenement building company or associations or, for example, from the Guarantee Foundation.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Financial problems.
I have to move out of my dwelling due to divorce.
I am also afraid that I will lose my residence permit.
What can I do?
You can find information on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling on how to look for a new dwelling.
A divorce may impact your residence permit, if you have a fixed-term residence permit due to family ties.
In some situations, however, the permit may be extended, if you still have fixed ties to Finland, such as a job.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Can I lose my residence permit.
The lessor threatened to evict me from my rental dwelling due to noise issues.
If you keep violating the housing rules and regulations, the lessor is entitled to cancel the tenancy agreement.
Try to reconcile the matter with the lessor before the cancellation.
You may also contact, for example, the Community Mediation Centre.
I had to move out of my dwelling and I have not found a new one.
What can I do?
In Finland, the municipalities offer services to the homeless.
Many organisations and parishes also help the homeless.
These services are targeted at those who have a municipality of residence in Finland.
If you find yourself without a dwelling, contact the social welfare office or centre of your municipality of residence.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Homelessness.
Conflicts with neighbours
My neighbour keeps making noise.
What can I do?
You neighbours cannot make noise, for example, during the night.
If your neighbour violates the housing rules and regulations often and in a gross manner, you can contact the building manager or lessor.
My neighbour keeps complaining to me about noise.
What kind of noise is allowed?
The housing rules and regulations state the time period when there must be silence in the building.
In a block of flats, you can usually find the housing rules and regulations in the staircase.
During the silent hours, it is forbidden to make loud noises, for example play an instrument or listen to loud music, but normal living is allowed.
From where can I get help in disputes with my neighbour?
If you and your neighbour have a dispute that you are unable to resolve by yourselves, you can seek for help from the Community Mediation Centre or the building manager.
Community mediation means that the neighbours discuss with each other and the discussion is led by an external mediator.
The parties may come to an agreement on how to resolve the situation during the meeting.
The mediation process is free of charge.

Contact the building maintenance company, building manager or lessor immediately.
It is important to repair such defects quickly before they escalate.
When we cook, a lot of condensation collects in the kitchen.
What can we do?
If your home does not have mechanical ventilation, open windows for ventilation purposes.
This is especially important, if you notice that water vapour or condensation forms on the windows when you cook.
Use the exhaust hood when cooking.
Check that the exhaust vents are open.
If you cause damage to the dwelling, you must pay for it.

Finnish education is of high quality.
Differences in the learning results of different schools are small and nearly all students complete comprehensive school within target time.
Preschool education, comprehensive education and upper secondary education is free of charge and also higher education is for the most part free of charge.
The goal is for everyone to have an equal opportunity to receive high quality education regardless of the family’s income and to grow up to become active citizens.
The education system includes early childhood education, preschool education, comprehensive education, upper secondary education and higher education.
Adult education is intended for adults and it includes a multitude of alternatives from comprehensive to higher education.
Early childhood education
In Finland, children are entitled to receive early childhood education before they reach school age.
Early childhood education is organised in day care centres and family day care.
Children may also participate in early education together with a parent in a playground.
Children may receive at least 20 hours of early childhood education per week, or more if the parents are working or studying.
The goal is to support children’s development and well-being.
They learn, for example, social and manual skills and gain different types of information.
Children also acquire skills that help them learn more.
A lot of playtime and outdoor activities are included.
If the child’s native language is not Finnish or Swedish, he or she will receive support in learning Finnish or Swedish.
The child may also receive special needs education, if necessary.
In Finland, municipalities organise early childhood education.
It is tax funded and therefore more affordable to families.
There is also private early childhood education available in Finland.
Trained early education teachers and child nurses work with children.
Preschool education
In Finland, children must attend preschool education for one year before compulsory education begins.
Preschool education usually starts during the year when the child turns six.
Municipalities organise preschool education and it is free of charge for families.
Preschool education is given by early education teachers who have graduated from a university.
Preschool education is usually organised from Monday to Friday, four hours a day.
In addition to preschool education, the child can also attend early education if the parents are working or studying.
During the preschool year, children learn skills that are useful in school, such as letters.
They are not, however, taught how to read.
If the child’s native language is not Finnish or Swedish, he or she will receive support in learning Finnish or Swedish.
A preschool day also includes playtime and outdoor activities.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Preschool education.
Comprehensive education
In Finland, comprehensive education normally starts during the year when the child turns seven.
All children residing in Finland permanently must attend comprehensive education.
Comprehensive school comprises of nine grades.
Compulsory education ends when the child has completed the entire comprehensive education syllabus or when ten years has passed since the beginning of compulsory education.
Finnish legislation guides comprehensive education.
National curriculum bases and local curriculums are also in use.
Municipalities organise comprehensive education.
It is tax funded and therefore free-of-charge for families.
There is about 20 hours of tuition per week for lower grades and more for higher grades.
All comprehensive school teachers in Finland have a Master’s degree.
Comprehensive school class teachers, who teach grades 1–6, are specialised in pedagogy.
Grade 7–9 teachers are specialised in the subjects they teach.
Teachers are at liberty to plan their tuition independently based on the national and local curricula.
Recently, curricula have emphasised, for example, entities that cover several subjects, investigating daily phenomena and information and communications technology.
Children often have the same teacher for the first six years.
The teacher gets to know the students well and is able to develop the tuition to suit their needs.
One important goal is that the students learn how to think for themselves and assume responsibility over their own learning.
The teacher evaluates the students’ progress in school.
In comprehensive education, all grades are given by the teacher.
There are no national examinations as such.
Instead, learning results are being monitored with sample-based evaluations.
These are usually organised in the ninth grade.
If the child or young person has only recently moved to Finland, he or she may receive preparatory education for comprehensive education.
Preparatory education usually takes one year.
After it, the student may continue to study Finnish or Swedish as a second language, or an S2 language, if he or she needs support in learning the language.
Adult immigrants who have no comprehensive school leaving certificate from their native country may complete comprehensive school in upper secondary schools for adults.
Read more about comprehensive education on the InfoFinland page Comprehensive education.
Upper secondary education
The most common options after comprehensive school are upper secondary school and vocational education.
They are considered upper secondary education.
Upper secondary education is usually free-of-charge for the students.
However, they must purchase their own books and other learning materials.
Upper secondary schools
Upper secondary schools provide all-round education which does not lead to any profession.
The same subjects are studied in upper secondary schools as in comprehensive school, but the studies are more demanding and independent.
At the end, students usually take the matriculation examination.
Upper secondary school takes 2–4 years, depending on the student.
After finishing, students are eligible to apply to universities, universities of applied sciences or upper secondary school based vocational education.
Most upper secondary schools provide education in Finnish or Swedish language.
Larger cities have some upper secondary schools that provide tuition in other languages, such as English or French.
Adults may take upper secondary school studies in upper secondary schools for adults.
There, it is possible to either take separate courses or complete the entire upper secondary school syllabus and take the matriculation examination.
Tuition may include contact teaching, distance education, online education and independent studies.

Preparatory education for upper secondary school
Good language skills are necessary in upper secondary school.
If the student’s native language is some other than Finnish or Swedish and his or her language skills are not yet at the level required for upper secondary school studies, he or she can apply to preparatory education for upper secondary school (LUVA).
Read more on the InfoFinland page Preparatory education for upper secondary school.
Vocational education
Vocational education is more practice-oriented than upper secondary school education.
Completing a vocational qualification takes about three years.
After this, students can continue their studies to complete a further vocational qualification or a specialised vocational degree.
On-the-job learning is an essential part of the qualification.
If students so choose, they can progress from vocational education to higher education.
Further vocational qualification or a specialised vocational degree can also be completed as competence-based qualifications if the student has already acquired the skills required for the qualification.
Vocational qualification can also be obtained through apprenticeship training.
In this case, students work in jobs within their own field, receive a salary that is at least equal to training salary and complete their studies at the same time.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Vocational education and training.
Preparatory vocational education
If your language or study skills are not adequate for vocational education, you can apply for preparatory vocational education (VALMA).
Read more on the InfoFinland page Preparatory vocational education.
Higher education
After finishing your upper secondary studies, you can progress to higher education.
In Finland, higher education is provided by universities and universities of applied sciences.
Studying in an institute of higher education may be free or subject to a charge.
You will be charged tuition fees if you are not an EU or EEA citizen or a family member of an EU or EEA citizen and are studying towards a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in an English-language degree programme.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Foreign students in Finland.
Universities of applied sciences
The education provided by universities of applied sciences is more practice-oriented than that offered by universities.
Tuition also includes on-the-job learning.
Completing a Bachelor’s degree in a university of applied sciences takes 3.5–4.5 years.
If you also want to complete a Master’s degree, you must first acquire three years of work experience from the same field.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Universities of applied sciences.
University tuition is based on scientific research.
Completing a Bachelor’s degree in a university takes about three years and Master’s degree about two more years.
Universities organise English language tuition in some of their degree programmes.
However, the teaching language of most degree programmes is either Finnish or Swedish.
Once you have completed a Master’s degree, you can apply for a right to complete further studies and earn a Licentiate’s or Doctoral degree.

Other study opportunities
In Finland, there are also many educational institutions offering persons of all ages studies which do not lead to a degree.
Most of these studies are intended for adults.
These institutions include adult education centres, summer universities, study centres and sports training centres.
The studies provide all-round education.
You can study languages, arts, crafts and communications, for instance.
Normally the student has to cover some of the expenses of the education.
However, in certain situations studying at these institutions may be free of charge.
Education is non-chargeable if, for example, education in reading and writing and other language training have been approved as parts of your integration plan.

All children residing in Finland permanently are subject to compulsory education, in other words, they must receive basic education.
Compulsory education is stipulated by law.
Compulsory education
starts in the year in which the child turns seven.
ends when the syllabus for basic education is completed or at latest after 10 years of starting compulsory education.
Compulsory education is usually completed in comprehensive school.
Comprehensive school consists of primary school (alakoulu) and secondary school (yläkoulu).
Primary school includes grades one to six while the secondary school includes grades seven to nine.
Comprehensive school normally lasts nine years: school begins in the first grade and ends in the ninth grade.
Comprehensive school is free.
Comprehensive education for immigrantsFinnish _ Swedish
Starting school
Children must be enrolled into school by their parents.
The municipality sends a compulsory education notice (oppivelvollisuusilmoitus) to appropriate homes at the beginning of each year.
The notice lists each child’s local school (lähikoulu).
The local school is usually the school that is closest to home.
Parents can also choose to send their child to a school other than the local school.
However, it is not always possible to get your child a place in any other than the local school.
You can complete the school enrolment at your child’s local school.
In some municipalities, you can also submit the enrolment online.
The enrolment time is at the beginning of the year, usually in January.
Different schools
Your child may also attend a school that is specialised in a certain subject.
Sometimes these schools are private schools.
A school may specialise, among others, in the following things:
Art
Physical education
Language
Internationality (for example European Schools)
Special pedagogy (for example, Steiner pedagogy)
Finland has a number of international schools.
Some of these schools use some other language instead of Finnish.
For example, in German Schools education is provided in German.
Foreign language schools are available in larger cities.
Foreign language classes may also be available in regular comprehensive schools.

School day and studying
School begins in August and ends in late May or early June.
School is out for the summer during June and July.
The length of school days varies between grades.
In primary school, the days are shorter than in secondary school.
Individual classes usually take 45 minutes.
A school week usually comprises approximately 20 classes.
Children have a single hot meal in school.
It is free-of-charge.
If your child has a special diet, please inform a teacher.
In comprehensive school, children study many compulsory subjects.
In the final grades of primary school and in secondary school, they can also choose optional subjects.
In school, all children can receive education in their own religion or in ethics.
Education in a particular religion must be arranged when a municipality contains at least three children of that religion.
Some schools have separate classes for students with talent in music or visual arts, for example.
These classes normally require separate application.
Immigrants and comprehensive school
A child or young person may receive preparatory education for basic education, during which he or she will study Finnish (or Swedish) and some other subjects.
Preparatory education is intended for all immigrant children whose skills are not yet good enough to attend basic education in a group.
Preparatory education usually takes one year.
After this, the student is transferred to a normal class.
If the child’s native language is not Finnish or Swedish, the municipality can arrange for education in the language in question.
This allows the child to study Finnish or Swedish as a second language, i.e. S2 language (S2-kieli).
A student will study Finnish (or Swedish) as a second language, if his or her Finnish or Swedish skills are not at a native level.
Upper secondary schools for adults organise basic education for adult immigrants who do not have a comprehensive school leaving certificate from their native country.
Ask for more information at the counselling services of your municipality or at the nearest upper secondary school for adults.
You can search for the contact information of upper secondary schools for adults through online search engines.

Messages between the home and school
In many municipalities, the school uses the Wilma online service to communicate about important matters.
The school gives the child’s parents a username and password for the service.
Through Wilma, you can stay in touch with your child’s teachers and receive information about your child’s learning, exams and absences as well as school events and holidays.
If your child must be absent from school, for example due to illness, inform the school through Wilma that morning.
It is important to monitor Wilma regularly.
If you need help with using Wilma, ask the school for guidance.
The City of Kerava has published instructions in different languages on how to use Wilma.
Please note that the login address for Wilma is different in different cities.

Student support and tenth grade
Comprehensive school students are supported in their school work.
Student counsellors talk to students about study methods and further education.
They also provide career selection guidance.
Student psychologists and school social workers help students in problematic situations.
Teachers can provide children with short-term remedial education.
Children who have difficulty learning and concentrating receive special needs education.
Special needs groups are smaller than regular classes.
Teachers maintain contact with parents.
They arrange meetings with parents and give parents information on their children’s studies.
Many schools keep in contact with parents through online systems.
Schools may also provide additional education, i.e. the so-called tenth grade (kymppiluokka).
These give students the chance to improve their grades and determine which field of study interests them.
You can apply for the tenth grade once you have received your certificate for completing comprehensive school.

The housing allowance (asumistuki) granted by Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland), is meant for housing-related costs.
Kela’s housing allowance covers the housing costs only partly.
You are eligible to receive housing allowance if you have low income and you live in Finland permanently.
Living in Finland permanently means that you have an actual home in Finland and that you mainly live in Finland.
In order to receive housing allowance, you must be covered by Finnish social security.
Kela’s housing-related benefits include:
general housing allowance
housing allowance for pensioners
housing assistance for conscripts and civil service men
If your income is not enough for you to live on even though you receive a housing allowance, you can apply to Kela for income support.
Read more about income support on InfoFinland webpage Financial problems.
Financial aid for housingFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Kela’s general housing allowance
The allowance is available either for an individual person or a household (ruokakunta).
People permanently living in the same dwelling belong to the same household.
Normally, a household refers to a married couple, an unmarried couple living together or a family.
A single person may also constitute a household.
Housing allowance is granted to a household jointly, based on a single application.
Take into consideration that if you live in the same dwelling, for example with your friend, and you have a joint tenancy agreement, you will be considered as belonging to the same household.
Instead, if one of you is the main tenant and the other one is a subtenant, and you are not immediate family, you will be considered as belonging to different households.
General housing allowance is available to
families with children
students
unmarried couples living together
those living alone or
those living in a community
What kinds of housing costs are accepted?
Housing allowance can be granted for a permanent dwelling in Finland.
The law stipulates which housing costs can be accepted when calculating housing allowance.
The dwelling can be
a rental dwelling
an owner-occupied dwelling
a right-of-occupancy dwelling
a part-ownership dwelling
Benefit is granted for the rent, charge for use and the dwelling upkeep costs.
Such upkeep costs contain, for example, heating costs and water rates.
Also a part of mortgage interest is considered when calculating the housing allowance.
Housing allowance is granted for reasonable housing costs.
In big towns, higher housing costs are accepted than in smaller ones.
Kela will not pay for all housing costs
You need to pay part of your housing costs yourself.
A so-called basic deductible (perusomavastuu) is determined for this purpose.
The amount of the basic deductible depends on
the number of adults and children belonging to the household
the combined gross income in the household (income before taxes)
With very low incomes, no basic deductible needs to be paid.
When the amount of your housing allowance is calculated, EUR 300 of your earned income per month is excluded from the calculation.
This amount does not affect the amount of your housing allowance.
This amount is called the earned-income deduction (ansiotulovähennys).
The earned-income deduction is made separately for each member of the household.
Housing allowance is only granted for reasonable housing costs.
When assessing reasonable housing costs, the following is taken into consideration:
the municipality in which the dwelling is located
the number of adults and children belonging to the household
If your home is more expensive than the limit specified in the Housing Allowance Act, you will have to pay a greater share of your housing costs.
The final housing allowance is calculated as follows:
The basic deductible is first deducted from your housing costs.
The housing allowance is 80 per cent of the remainder.
Notify Kela of changes
If there are changes to your income, living arrangement, family situation or other circumstances, notify Kela about these changes without delay.
Kela’s decision provides detailed information on which changes to notify.
General housing allowanceFinnish _ Swedish _ English
What is a householdFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Applying for housing allowance
You can apply for general housing allowance with the Kela form Application for Housing Allowance (AT1).
You can also apply for general housing allowance online.
You also need to enclose
a copy of your tenancy agreement and a document showing the amount of your rent (for rental dwellings)
documentation on maintenance charges and mortgage (for owner-occupied dwellings)
paycheck, i.e., a payslip from your employer
if you live in a community, authorisation (proxy) from other residents for applying for housing allowance on everyone's behalf.
Send the application to Kela’s office or fill in the application online.
Kela serves its customers in local offices, by telephone, by mail and through online services.
When running your personal errands in Kela’s office, you need to present a proof of identity, for example your passport.

According to the law, children must attend preschool education or other similar activities for one year before compulsory education begins.
Preschool education (esiopetus) prepares children for comprehensive school.
Children normally enter preschool education at the age of six and comprehensive school at the age of seven.
Parents normally enrol their children in preschool education in January or February.
Check the time well in advance with your local school services (koulutoimi) or education services (sivistystoimi).
Municipalities organise preschool education.
Municipalities can also purchase preschool education services from private day care centres, for example.
Preschool education is free-of-charge.
During the day, the child will receive a free meal.
If the child lives far away (over 5 km) or the route is difficult, he or she will receive free transport.
In addition to preschool education, the child can also attend early education if the parents are working or studying.
Preschool day
Preschool days last about four hours.
Children often attend preschool on the premises of a day care centre or school.
In preschool, children learn mathematics, environmental and natural awareness as well as art and culture.
They pick up new things through play.
Parents have an important role in preschool education.
They support their child’s learning.
The teachers prepare an individual curriculum for each child.
Parents can assist the instructors in the preparation of the plan.
Languages and cultures in preschool education
Children whose native language is something other than Finnish or Swedish will study Finnish or Swedish as a foreign language.
In addition, they can study their own native language if the municipality organises such education.
In preschool, children can receive education in their own religion or in ethics.
Preschool education teaches children to value their native language and culture.
They also learn to respect the languages and cultures of other people.

Fire safety
A smoke detector can save your life.
If a fire breaks out in your home, a smoke detector emits a loud alarm sound so that you can evacuate the premises in time.
Ensure that your home is equipped with a sufficient number of smoke detectors.
Smoke detectors are sold in department stores and hardware shops.
One smoke detector can cover up to 60 square metres.
For example, if your home is 65 square metres in size, you will need two smoke detectors.
If your home has more than one floor, calculate the floor area of each floor separately.
There must be a smoke detector on every floor.
Check regularly that the smoke detector functions properly.
Replace the batteries, if necessary – preferably once a year.
You are responsible for the smoke detectors even if you are living in a rental dwelling.
Finnish dwellings often have a sauna.
Never place anything above the sauna heater even if you are not using the sauna, as this may cause a fire.
For example, do not dry laundry above the sauna heater or near it.
Always switch off an electric sauna heater after use.
When leaving your home, remember to check that the stove, sauna heater and iron, for example, have been switched off.
It is also a good idea to have a fire extinguisher in your home.
Some blocks of flats also have a fire extinguisher in the stairway.
Find out where the nearest fire extinguisher is located.
Ensure that you have a fire blanket in your home.
It is advisable to keep it near the stove, for example.
Do not leave food on a hot stove unattended.
Be particularly careful when cooking at night.
Do not cook food when intoxicated.
Do not store items on the stove.
Children, pets or inadvertent contact may accidentally switch on the stove.
This may ignite the items on the stove.
If the grease catches fire when you are cooking, smother the flames with the lid of a pot or frying pan, or a fire blanket.
Do not use water.
Remember to switch off electrical devices after use.
An iron must also be disconnected from the power socket.
Do not use electrical devices that are in poor conditions or whose cable is faulty.
If an electrical device catches fire, do not use water.
Put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, for example.
If you have electric radiators or other heaters in your home, do not place fabrics, clothes or any other items on them.
Leave enough space around your television, microwave oven, refrigerator and freezer.
Do not cover them.
The rear grate of the freezer and refrigerator should be cleaned of dust once a year with a vacuum, for example, if this is possible.
Do not smoke indoors.
Do not leave candles burning unattended.
Do not burn candles near curtains even when you are present in the room.
If a fire breaks out, call the emergency number 112.

Preventing water damage
Do not leave a washing machine or dishwasher on when leaving the home.
Regularly check the water pipes in your home for leaks and ensure that water does not leak on the floor from any appliances.
Keep the washing machine and dishwasher valves closed when not using the machines.
A plastic leak pan is required under the refrigerator, freezer and dishwasher.
It is installed at the same time as the device.
Do not install a dishwasher yourself – leave it to a professional.
If there is a water leak in your home, try to close off the water line with the shut-off valve.
If you live in a block of flats or terraced house, immediately report leaks to the housing company’s on-call number.
If you live in a detached house, notify an on-call plumbing firm.
Electrical work
The mains voltage in Finland is 230 V.
In Finland, actual electrical work may only be conducted by professional electricians.
You may carry out some minor electrical work, if you have the requisite skills.
For example, you can:
replace a fuse
replace a light bulb
repair a single-phase extension cord (voltage 230 V)
connect a light fixture to the terminal in the ceiling
replace a broken single-phase connection cord (voltage 230 V) and plug with a new functional one.

Early childhood education is intended for children under school age.
In Finland, municipalities offer municipal early childhood education at day-care centres, for example.
There are also private day-care centres.
Early childhood education is education, teaching and care that have been pedagogically planned, with carefully considered goals.
Trained early education teachers and child nurses work in early education.
Usually, either of the parents looks after the child at home until at least the end of the parental leave, in other words, until the child is around nine months old.
If you also look after your child at home after the period of parental leave, you are entitled to leave from work for childcare purposes until the child’s third birthday.
You can find more information about leave on the InfoFinland page Family leave.
You can apply for financial support for childcare at home from Kela.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
Municipal early childhood education
If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you can apply for a place in municipal early childhood education for your child after the period of parental leave.
At that point, the child will be approximately nine months old.
If you do not have an official municipality of residence in Finland, you are considered a resident of the municipality in which you reside.
If both parents work, their child has the right to full-time early education.
If one parent is at home, the child’s right to early education depends on their municipality of residence.
In some municipalities, the child may have a right to full-time early education even if one parent is at home.
In other municipalities, the child has a right to 20 hours of early education per week if one parent is at home.
However, the family can apply for a right to full-time early education if the child needs special support with learning Finnish or because of a difficult family situation.
You can apply for a place in
a day care centre (päiväkoti)
At day-care centres, children are in larger groups than in group family day care.
Family day care involves a care provider looking after the children in his or her own home.
Some family day care providers look after children in the children's home.
Apply for a municipal early childhood education place from your municipality at least four months before your child is due to start day care.
A place can be granted within two weeks if the parents get a job or a student position.
The early education fee (varhaiskasvatusmaksu) depends on
the family’s income;
family size; and
how many hours a week your child will attend early childhood education.
A discount is granted for the day care fees of any siblings.
If the family has a very low income, early childhood education may be free of charge.
For further information, contact the advisory services of your own municipality.
Private early childhood education
The different forms of private early childhood education include:
private day care centres or private group family day care centres
family day care providers or
day care given by a child carer hired by the family to work at their home
You can apply for early childhood education directly from a private day-care centre or a private group family day-care centre.
You can also seek a private family day care provider who will look after children in his or her own home, or hire a child carer to work in your home.
If you hire a child carer to work in your home, you become an employer and must attend to an employer’s obligations.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Employer’s rights and obligations.
You can also hire a child carer together with another family.
The municipality supervises private early childhood education.
The costs of private early childhood education vary.
However, you can receive support for it from Kela.
In such a case, private early childhood education does not necessarily cost much more than municipal early childhood education.
Private day care allowance
If your child has a municipality of residence in Finland, you can apply for private day care allowance from Kela.
The child care provider must be approved by the municipality.
You can apply for private day care allowance (yksityisen hoidon tuki) if
your child is under school age and is placed in a private day care centre; or
your child is looked after by another type of private day care provider.
You cannot apply for private day care allowance if the care provider is a family member of the child or if the child and the carer live in the same household.
Neither can you receive private day care allowance if your child is placed in municipal early childhood education.
The amount of allowance depends on the income of the child's family and on the municipality in which the family resides, among other things.
Kela pays the allowance directly to the hired child carer or other child care provider.
Private day care allowance is taxable income.
This allowance is not paid abroad.
Further information on private day care allowance is available on Kela’s website.
Kela offers a telephone service for families with children.

What takes place in early childhood education?
Early childhood education includes a range of activities, for example games, sports, music, crafts and excursions.
Children can also take a nap or rest during the day.
The goal of these activities is to further the development of and learning among children.
Children also learn social skills.
The child is supported in learning Finnish or Swedish if he or she has another mother tongue.
The child may also receive special needs education, if necessary.
However, the day care centre is not a school.
Children do not study subjects or attend classes.
During the day, the children eat three meals: breakfast, lunch and a snack.
If your child has a special diet, please inform the early childhood education teachers.
Your family’s religious convictions or life philosophies will be taken into consideration in early childhood education.
Some localities provide day care centres in which children and teachers speak a language other than Finnish or Swedish.
Days in early childhood education normally begin in the morning and end in the afternoon.
However, some day-care centres and family day care providers are open around the clock due to the parents' studies or working hours.

Looking for a dwelling
I cannot find an affordable rental dwelling.
There are not many rental dwellings available in the largest cities.
Dwellings are more expensive near the city centre.
Therefore, many Finns live in quite small dwellings.
Many also live far from the city centre or in some other adjacent municipality so they have a longer commute to work.
If you cannot find an affordable dwelling in the area you like, consider the possibility of living in a smaller dwelling or further away from the city centre.
Many smaller cities have plenty of available dwellings and the prices are more affordable.
If you are planning to move from a small town to a large city, look for a dwelling in advance.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
I submitted an application for a municipal rental dwelling, but I have not received one even though much time has elapsed.
The number of municipal dwellings does not allow their allocation to all applicants.
It is recommended to apply for a dwelling from many different places.
Also keep an eye on the supply of private rental dwellings.
Remember to update your application while it is still valid, otherwise the application will expire.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
I suspect that I have been discriminated against when I have looked for a dwelling.
From where can I get help?
According to the law, lessors are not allowed to discriminate against anybody, for example due to ethnic origin, religion or nationality, when selecting tenants.
A private lessor, however, is entitled to select the tenant of the dwelling without any need to justify the selection.
If you suspect that you have been discriminated against, you can ask for advice, for example, from the customer service of the Non-Discrimination Ombudsman.

Renting a dwelling
Do I have to pay a commission to the agent when I rent a dwelling?
The commission is usually paid by the lessor.
You yourself have to pay the commission only in the case where you have concluded in advance a written commission agreement with the agent.
If you have not concluded a written commission agreement, the agent is not entitled to demand commission from you.
If he/she tries to do so, you can file a notice of a crime.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Crimes.
The agent demands a payment for seeing the dwelling.
Do I have to pay?
You are entitled to see the dwelling in advance and the agent cannot demand payment for it.
If you have problems regarding the commission, you can contact the Consumer Advisory Service.
linkkiFinnish Competition and Consumer Authority:
Consumer consultingFinnish _ Swedish _ English
The agent demands that I pay a reservation fee on the rental dwelling.
Do I have to pay?
There is no such thing as a dwelling reservation fee in Finland.
Do not pay anything until you have a written tenancy agreement on the dwelling.
Read more about the rental dwelling fees, such as the rental security deposit, on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
The lessor requires that I take home insurance.
Where can I take out home insurance?
Can I cancel it later?
Home insurance is sold by many insurance companies in Finland.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Everyday life in Finland.
It is recommended to take out home insurance, even if it is not required in the tenancy agreement.
You are not recommended to cancel the home insurance while you live in the dwelling.
If, for example, you cause water damage and you do not have a home insurance, you have to pay all the repair costs yourself.
The total amount can be tens of thousands of euros.
What should I take into account before signing a tenancy agreement?
Take a good look at the dwelling before renting it.
Check that the dwelling actually exists, i.e. the address of the dwelling matches the one indicated on the agreement.
Also ensure that the dwelling is in the condition described to you.
Check from the tenancy agreement, for example, the terms and conditions of the tenancy and the period of notice.
You are also recommended to go over the dwelling and its possible defects with the owner or his/her representative.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
When does the rental security deposit have to be paid?
Do not pay the rental security deposit, until you have a written tenancy agreement.
The lessor can assign a bank account for paying the rental security deposit.
You can also open a separate account for the rental security deposit at a bank.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
The lessor suggested that we could conclude an oral tenancy agreement.
Is an oral agreement sufficient?
Always conclude the tenancy agreement in writing.
This way you can prove what you have agreed in case of problems.
Keep the tenancy agreement in a safe place.
There are a few defects in the rental dwelling.
Can the lessor demand afterwards that I should compensate for the defects that I have not caused?
You are recommended to write down the defects of the dwelling together with the lessor at the beginning of the tenancy.
You can also take photos of the defects.
This way you can ensure that you will not be held responsible for the defects you did not cause.
Giving notice
I gave notice on my rental dwelling, but the lessor demands that I pay rent until he/she can find a new tenant.
Do I have to pay?
If you have a non-fixed-term tenancy agreement, the period of notice is usually one calendar month.
The period begins from the end of the month you gave notice in.
Once the period of notice has expired, the lessor cannot demand rent from you.
You cannot give notice when a fixed-term tenancy agreement is valid.
If necessary, you can try to negotiate an earlier termination of the tenancy agreement.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
I have a non-fixed-term tenancy agreement.
I gave notice on 2 June.
The lessor demands that I also pay rent in July.
Do I have to pay?
If your tenancy agreement does not state otherwise, the period of notice is calculated according to the law from the end of the calendar month you give notice in.
If you give notice on 2 June, the period of notice will begin on 30 June and last for one month.
Therefore, you must pay rent for July.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
Loss of dwelling
I do not have money to pay rent.
What can I do?
Contact your lessor as soon as possible and try to negotiate more time.
Determine whether you can postpone other payments in order to be able to pay your rent.
Also, contact your bank and find out whether your bank can grant you a loan so that you are able to pay your rent.
Find out from KELA whether you are entitled to receive housing allowance or some other allowance.
You can also ask for advice and help from the municipal debt counselling, social welfare office or a housing counsellor of the municipality, tenement building company or associations or, for example, from the Guarantee Foundation.

I have to move out of my dwelling due to divorce.
I am also afraid that I will lose my residence permit.
What can I do?

A divorce may impact your residence permit, if you have a fixed-term residence permit due to family ties.
In some situations, however, the permit may be extended, if you still have fixed ties to Finland, such as a job.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Can I lose my residence permit.
The lessor threatened to evict me from my rental dwelling due to noise issues.
If you keep violating the housing rules and regulations, the lessor is entitled to cancel the tenancy agreement.

In a block of flats, you can usually find the housing rules and regulations in the staircase.
During the silent hours, it is forbidden to make loud noises, for example play an instrument or listen to loud music, but normal living is allowed.
From where can I get help in disputes with my neighbour?
If you and your neighbour have a dispute that you are unable to resolve by yourselves, you can seek for help from the Community Mediation Centre or the building manager.
Community mediation means that the neighbours discuss with each other and the discussion is led by an external mediator.
The parties may come to an agreement on how to resolve the situation during the meeting.
The mediation process is free of charge.

Finnish education is of high quality.
Differences in the learning results of different schools are small and nearly all students complete comprehensive school within target time.
Preschool education, comprehensive education and upper secondary education is free of charge and also higher education is for the most part free of charge.
The goal is for everyone to have an equal opportunity to receive high quality education regardless of the family’s income and to grow up to become active citizens.
The education system includes early childhood education, preschool education, comprehensive education, upper secondary education and higher education.
Adult education is intended for adults and it includes a multitude of alternatives from comprehensive to higher education.
Early childhood education
In Finland, children are entitled to receive early childhood education before they reach school age.
Early childhood education is organised in day care centres and family day care.
Children may also participate in early education together with a parent in a playground.
Children may receive at least 20 hours of early childhood education per week, or more if the parents are working or studying.
The goal is to support children’s development and well-being.
They learn, for example, social and manual skills and gain different types of information.
Children also acquire skills that help them learn more.
A lot of playtime and outdoor activities are included.
If the child’s native language is not Finnish or Swedish, he or she will receive support in learning Finnish or Swedish.
The child may also receive special needs education, if necessary.
In Finland, municipalities organise early childhood education.
It is tax funded and therefore more affordable to families.
There is also private early childhood education available in Finland.
Trained early education teachers and child nurses work with children.
Preschool education
In Finland, children must attend preschool education for one year before compulsory education begins.
Preschool education usually starts during the year when the child turns six.
Municipalities organise preschool education and it is free of charge for families.
Preschool education is given by early education teachers who have graduated from a university.
Preschool education is usually organised from Monday to Friday, four hours a day.
In addition to preschool education, the child can also attend early education if the parents are working or studying.
During the preschool year, children learn skills that are useful in school, such as letters.
They are not, however, taught how to read.
If the child’s native language is not Finnish or Swedish, he or she will receive support in learning Finnish or Swedish.
A preschool day also includes playtime and outdoor activities.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Preschool education.
Comprehensive education
In Finland, comprehensive education normally starts during the year when the child turns seven.
All children residing in Finland permanently must attend comprehensive education.

Municipalities organise comprehensive education.
It is tax funded and therefore free-of-charge for families.
There is about 20 hours of tuition per week for lower grades and more for higher grades.
All comprehensive school teachers in Finland have a Master’s degree.
Comprehensive school class teachers, who teach grades 1–6, are specialised in pedagogy.
Grade 7–9 teachers are specialised in the subjects they teach.
Teachers are at liberty to plan their tuition independently based on the national and local curricula.
Recently, curricula have emphasised, for example, entities that cover several subjects, investigating daily phenomena and information and communications technology.
Children often have the same teacher for the first six years.
The teacher gets to know the students well and is able to develop the tuition to suit their needs.
One important goal is that the students learn how to think for themselves and assume responsibility over their own learning.
The teacher evaluates the students’ progress in school.
In comprehensive education, all grades are given by the teacher.
There are no national examinations as such.
Instead, learning results are being monitored with sample-based evaluations.
These are usually organised in the ninth grade.
If the child or young person has only recently moved to Finland, he or she may receive preparatory education for comprehensive education.
Preparatory education usually takes one year.
After it, the student may continue to study Finnish or Swedish as a second language, or an S2 language, if he or she needs support in learning the language.
Adult immigrants who have no comprehensive school leaving certificate from their native country may complete comprehensive school in upper secondary schools for adults.
Read more about comprehensive education on the InfoFinland page Comprehensive education.
Upper secondary education

They are considered upper secondary education.
Upper secondary education is usually free-of-charge for the students.
However, they must purchase their own books and other learning materials.
Upper secondary schools
Upper secondary schools provide all-round education which does not lead to any profession.
The same subjects are studied in upper secondary schools as in comprehensive school, but the studies are more demanding and independent.
At the end, students usually take the matriculation examination.
Upper secondary school takes 2–4 years, depending on the student.
After finishing, students are eligible to apply to universities, universities of applied sciences or upper secondary school based vocational education.
Most upper secondary schools provide education in Finnish or Swedish language.
Larger cities have some upper secondary schools that provide tuition in other languages, such as English or French.
Adults may take upper secondary school studies in upper secondary schools for adults.
There, it is possible to either take separate courses or complete the entire upper secondary school syllabus and take the matriculation examination.
Tuition may include contact teaching, distance education, online education and independent studies.
Read more about upper secondary school studies on the InfoFinland page Upper secondary school.
Preparatory education for upper secondary school
Good language skills are necessary in upper secondary school.
If the student’s native language is some other than Finnish or Swedish and his or her language skills are not yet at the level required for upper secondary school studies, he or she can apply to preparatory education for upper secondary school (LUVA).
Read more on the InfoFinland page Preparatory education for upper secondary school.
Vocational education
Vocational education is more practice-oriented than upper secondary school education.
Completing a vocational qualification takes about three years.
After this, students can continue their studies to complete a further vocational qualification or a specialised vocational degree.
On-the-job learning is an essential part of the qualification.
If students so choose, they can progress from vocational education to higher education.
Further vocational qualification or a specialised vocational degree can also be completed as competence-based qualifications if the student has already acquired the skills required for the qualification.
Vocational qualification can also be obtained through apprenticeship training.
In this case, students work in jobs within their own field, receive a salary that is at least equal to training salary and complete their studies at the same time.

The housing allowance (asumistuki) granted by Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland), is meant for housing-related costs.
Kela’s housing allowance covers the housing costs only partly.
You are eligible to receive housing allowance if you have low income and you live in Finland permanently.
Living in Finland permanently means that you have an actual home in Finland and that you mainly live in Finland.
In order to receive housing allowance, you must be covered by Finnish social security.
Kela’s housing-related benefits include:
general housing allowance
housing allowance for pensioners
housing assistance for conscripts and civil service men
If your income is not enough for you to live on even though you receive a housing allowance, you can apply to Kela for income support.
Read more about income support on InfoFinland webpage Financial problems.
Financial aid for housingFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Kela’s general housing allowance
The allowance is available either for an individual person or a household (ruokakunta).
People permanently living in the same dwelling belong to the same household.
Normally, a household refers to a married couple, an unmarried couple living together or a family.
A single person may also constitute a household.
Housing allowance is granted to a household jointly, based on a single application.
Take into consideration that if you live in the same dwelling, for example with your friend, and you have a joint tenancy agreement, you will be considered as belonging to the same household.
Instead, if one of you is the main tenant and the other one is a subtenant, and you are not immediate family, you will be considered as belonging to different households.
General housing allowance is available to
families with children
students
married couples and those in registered partnership
unmarried couples living together
those living alone or
those living in a community
What kinds of housing costs are accepted?
Housing allowance can be granted for a permanent dwelling in Finland.
The law stipulates which housing costs can be accepted when calculating housing allowance.
The dwelling can be
a rental dwelling
an owner-occupied dwelling
a right-of-occupancy dwelling
a part-ownership dwelling
Benefit is granted for the rent, charge for use and the dwelling upkeep costs.
Such upkeep costs contain, for example, heating costs and water rates.
Also a part of mortgage interest is considered when calculating the housing allowance.
Housing allowance is granted for reasonable housing costs.
In big towns, higher housing costs are accepted than in smaller ones.
Kela will not pay for all housing costs
You need to pay part of your housing costs yourself.
A so-called basic deductible (perusomavastuu) is determined for this purpose.
The amount of the basic deductible depends on
the number of adults and children belonging to the household
the combined gross income in the household (income before taxes)
With very low incomes, no basic deductible needs to be paid.
When the amount of your housing allowance is calculated, EUR 300 of your earned income per month is excluded from the calculation.
This amount does not affect the amount of your housing allowance.
This amount is called the earned-income deduction (ansiotulovähennys).
The earned-income deduction is made separately for each member of the household.
Housing allowance is only granted for reasonable housing costs.
When assessing reasonable housing costs, the following is taken into consideration:
the municipality in which the dwelling is located
the number of adults and children belonging to the household
If your home is more expensive than the limit specified in the Housing Allowance Act, you will have to pay a greater share of your housing costs.
The final housing allowance is calculated as follows:
The basic deductible is first deducted from your housing costs.
The housing allowance is 80 per cent of the remainder.
Notify Kela of changes
If there are changes to your income, living arrangement, family situation or other circumstances, notify Kela about these changes without delay.
Kela’s decision provides detailed information on which changes to notify.

What is a householdFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Applying for housing allowance
You can apply for general housing allowance with the Kela form Application for Housing Allowance (AT1).
You can also apply for general housing allowance online.
You also need to enclose
a copy of your tenancy agreement and a document showing the amount of your rent (for rental dwellings)
documentation on maintenance charges and mortgage (for owner-occupied dwellings)
paycheck, i.e., a payslip from your employer
if you live in a community, authorisation (proxy) from other residents for applying for housing allowance on everyone's behalf.
Send the application to Kela’s office or fill in the application online.
Kela serves its customers in local offices, by telephone, by mail and through online services.
When running your personal errands in Kela’s office, you need to present a proof of identity, for example your passport.
Applying for housing allowanceFinnish _ Swedish _ English
If you are a student, you can apply for rental housing that is particularly intended for students.
The rent of student housing is usually cheaper than other rental housing.
Student housing are leased by student housing foundations, student unions, student associations and some other foundations.
Some institutes also have their own student halls.
Ask from your own institute where you can apply for student housing.
You can apply for student housing as soon as you have received a study place.
In the larger cities it may take several weeks or months before you receive student housing.
If you are granted student housing, you can usually live there throughout your studies.
You must, however, be a fulltime student and make progress in your studies.
Your lessor may terminate your tenancy agreement if you have not completed enough courses.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, you can apply for a housing allowance from Kela to cover your housing costs.
Read more about the housing allowance on the InfoFinland page Housing allowance.
If your only reason for being in Finland is studying, you are residing in Finland temporarily and are not covered by Finnish social security.
If you have other reasons for residing in Finland, such as a job, you may be covered by Finnish social security.

Fire safety
A smoke detector can save your life.
If a fire breaks out in your home, a smoke detector emits a loud alarm sound so that you can evacuate the premises in time.
Ensure that your home is equipped with a sufficient number of smoke detectors.
Smoke detectors are sold in department stores and hardware shops.
One smoke detector can cover up to 60 square metres.
For example, if your home is 65 square metres in size, you will need two smoke detectors.
If your home has more than one floor, calculate the floor area of each floor separately.
There must be a smoke detector on every floor.
Check regularly that the smoke detector functions properly.
Replace the batteries, if necessary – preferably once a year.
You are responsible for the smoke detectors even if you are living in a rental dwelling.
Finnish dwellings often have a sauna.
Never place anything above the sauna heater even if you are not using the sauna, as this may cause a fire.
For example, do not dry laundry above the sauna heater or near it.
Always switch off an electric sauna heater after use.
When leaving your home, remember to check that the stove, sauna heater and iron, for example, have been switched off.
It is also a good idea to have a fire extinguisher in your home.
Some blocks of flats also have a fire extinguisher in the stairway.
Find out where the nearest fire extinguisher is located.
Ensure that you have a fire blanket in your home.
It is advisable to keep it near the stove, for example.
Do not leave food on a hot stove unattended.
Be particularly careful when cooking at night.
Do not cook food when intoxicated.
Do not store items on the stove.
Children, pets or inadvertent contact may accidentally switch on the stove.
This may ignite the items on the stove.
If the grease catches fire when you are cooking, smother the flames with the lid of a pot or frying pan, or a fire blanket.
Do not use water.
Remember to switch off electrical devices after use.
An iron must also be disconnected from the power socket.
Do not use electrical devices that are in poor conditions or whose cable is faulty.
If an electrical device catches fire, do not use water.
Put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, for example.
If you have electric radiators or other heaters in your home, do not place fabrics, clothes or any other items on them.
Leave enough space around your television, microwave oven, refrigerator and freezer.
Do not cover them.
The rear grate of the freezer and refrigerator should be cleaned of dust once a year with a vacuum, for example, if this is possible.
Do not smoke indoors.
Do not leave candles burning unattended.
Do not burn candles near curtains even when you are present in the room.
If a fire breaks out, call the emergency number 112.

Preventing water damage
Do not leave a washing machine or dishwasher on when leaving the home.
Regularly check the water pipes in your home for leaks and ensure that water does not leak on the floor from any appliances.
Keep the washing machine and dishwasher valves closed when not using the machines.
A plastic leak pan is required under the refrigerator, freezer and dishwasher.
It is installed at the same time as the device.
Do not install a dishwasher yourself – leave it to a professional.
If there is a water leak in your home, try to close off the water line with the shut-off valve.
If you live in a block of flats or terraced house, immediately report leaks to the housing company’s on-call number.
If you live in a detached house, notify an on-call plumbing firm.
Electrical work
The mains voltage in Finland is 230 V.
In Finland, actual electrical work may only be conducted by professional electricians.
You may carry out some minor electrical work, if you have the requisite skills.
For example, you can:
replace a fuse
replace a light bulb
repair a single-phase extension cord (voltage 230 V)
connect a light fixture to the terminal in the ceiling
replace a broken single-phase connection cord (voltage 230 V) and plug with a new functional one.

Looking for a dwelling
I cannot find an affordable rental dwelling.
There are not many rental dwellings available in the largest cities.
Dwellings are more expensive near the city centre.
Therefore, many Finns live in quite small dwellings.
Many also live far from the city centre or in some other adjacent municipality so they have a longer commute to work.
If you cannot find an affordable dwelling in the area you like, consider the possibility of living in a smaller dwelling or further away from the city centre.
Many smaller cities have plenty of available dwellings and the prices are more affordable.
If you are planning to move from a small town to a large city, look for a dwelling in advance.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
I submitted an application for a municipal rental dwelling, but I have not received one even though much time has elapsed.
The number of municipal dwellings does not allow their allocation to all applicants.
It is recommended to apply for a dwelling from many different places.
Also keep an eye on the supply of private rental dwellings.
Remember to update your application while it is still valid, otherwise the application will expire.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
I suspect that I have been discriminated against when I have looked for a dwelling.
From where can I get help?
According to the law, lessors are not allowed to discriminate against anybody, for example due to ethnic origin, religion or nationality, when selecting tenants.
A private lessor, however, is entitled to select the tenant of the dwelling without any need to justify the selection.
If you suspect that you have been discriminated against, you can ask for advice, for example, from the customer service of the Non-Discrimination Ombudsman.
Customer service of the Non-Discrimination OmbudsmanFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Renting a dwelling
Do I have to pay a commission to the agent when I rent a dwelling?
The commission is usually paid by the lessor.
You yourself have to pay the commission only in the case where you have concluded in advance a written commission agreement with the agent.
If you have not concluded a written commission agreement, the agent is not entitled to demand commission from you.
If he/she tries to do so, you can file a notice of a crime.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Crimes.
The agent demands a payment for seeing the dwelling.
Do I have to pay?
You are entitled to see the dwelling in advance and the agent cannot demand payment for it.
If you have problems regarding the commission, you can contact the Consumer Advisory Service.
linkkiFinnish Competition and Consumer Authority:
Consumer consultingFinnish _ Swedish _ English
The agent demands that I pay a reservation fee on the rental dwelling.
Do I have to pay?
There is no such thing as a dwelling reservation fee in Finland.
Do not pay anything until you have a written tenancy agreement on the dwelling.
Read more about the rental dwelling fees, such as the rental security deposit, on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
The lessor requires that I take home insurance.
Where can I take out home insurance?
Can I cancel it later?
Home insurance is sold by many insurance companies in Finland.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Everyday life in Finland.
It is recommended to take out home insurance, even if it is not required in the tenancy agreement.
You are not recommended to cancel the home insurance while you live in the dwelling.
If, for example, you cause water damage and you do not have a home insurance, you have to pay all the repair costs yourself.
The total amount can be tens of thousands of euros.
What should I take into account before signing a tenancy agreement?
Take a good look at the dwelling before renting it.
Check that the dwelling actually exists, i.e. the address of the dwelling matches the one indicated on the agreement.
Also ensure that the dwelling is in the condition described to you.
Check from the tenancy agreement, for example, the terms and conditions of the tenancy and the period of notice.
You are also recommended to go over the dwelling and its possible defects with the owner or his/her representative.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
When does the rental security deposit have to be paid?
Do not pay the rental security deposit, until you have a written tenancy agreement.
The lessor can assign a bank account for paying the rental security deposit.
You can also open a separate account for the rental security deposit at a bank.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
The lessor suggested that we could conclude an oral tenancy agreement.
Is an oral agreement sufficient?
Always conclude the tenancy agreement in writing.
This way you can prove what you have agreed in case of problems.
Keep the tenancy agreement in a safe place.
There are a few defects in the rental dwelling.
Can the lessor demand afterwards that I should compensate for the defects that I have not caused?
You are recommended to write down the defects of the dwelling together with the lessor at the beginning of the tenancy.
You can also take photos of the defects.
This way you can ensure that you will not be held responsible for the defects you did not cause.
Giving notice
I gave notice on my rental dwelling, but the lessor demands that I pay rent until he/she can find a new tenant.
Do I have to pay?
If you have a non-fixed-term tenancy agreement, the period of notice is usually one calendar month.
The period begins from the end of the month you gave notice in.
Once the period of notice has expired, the lessor cannot demand rent from you.
You cannot give notice when a fixed-term tenancy agreement is valid.
If necessary, you can try to negotiate an earlier termination of the tenancy agreement.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
I have a non-fixed-term tenancy agreement.
I gave notice on 2 June.
The lessor demands that I also pay rent in July.
Do I have to pay?
If your tenancy agreement does not state otherwise, the period of notice is calculated according to the law from the end of the calendar month you give notice in.
If you give notice on 2 June, the period of notice will begin on 30 June and last for one month.
Therefore, you must pay rent for July.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement.
Loss of dwelling
I do not have money to pay rent.
What can I do?
Contact your lessor as soon as possible and try to negotiate more time.
Determine whether you can postpone other payments in order to be able to pay your rent.
Also, contact your bank and find out whether your bank can grant you a loan so that you are able to pay your rent.
Find out from KELA whether you are entitled to receive housing allowance or some other allowance.
You can also ask for advice and help from the municipal debt counselling, social welfare office or a housing counsellor of the municipality, tenement building company or associations or, for example, from the Guarantee Foundation.

I have to move out of my dwelling due to divorce.
I am also afraid that I will lose my residence permit.
What can I do?
You can find information on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling on how to look for a new dwelling.
A divorce may impact your residence permit, if you have a fixed-term residence permit due to family ties.
In some situations, however, the permit may be extended, if you still have fixed ties to Finland, such as a job.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Can I lose my residence permit.
The lessor threatened to evict me from my rental dwelling due to noise issues.
If you keep violating the housing rules and regulations, the lessor is entitled to cancel the tenancy agreement.
Try to reconcile the matter with the lessor before the cancellation.
You may also contact, for example, the Community Mediation Centre.
I had to move out of my dwelling and I have not found a new one.
What can I do?
In Finland, the municipalities offer services to the homeless.
Many organisations and parishes also help the homeless.
These services are targeted at those who have a municipality of residence in Finland.
If you find yourself without a dwelling, contact the social welfare office or centre of your municipality of residence.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Homelessness.
Conflicts with neighbours
My neighbour keeps making noise.
What can I do?
You neighbours cannot make noise, for example, during the night.
If your neighbour violates the housing rules and regulations often and in a gross manner, you can contact the building manager or lessor.
My neighbour keeps complaining to me about noise.
What kind of noise is allowed?
The housing rules and regulations state the time period when there must be silence in the building.
In a block of flats, you can usually find the housing rules and regulations in the staircase.
During the silent hours, it is forbidden to make loud noises, for example play an instrument or listen to loud music, but normal living is allowed.
From where can I get help in disputes with my neighbour?
If you and your neighbour have a dispute that you are unable to resolve by yourselves, you can seek for help from the Community Mediation Centre or the building manager.
Community mediation means that the neighbours discuss with each other and the discussion is led by an external mediator.
The parties may come to an agreement on how to resolve the situation during the meeting.
The mediation process is free of charge.

Everyday housing matters
What do I do if I forget my key at home?
Usually, in a building management company the building maintenance company or building manager keeps copies of the keys and opens the door for a fee.
There is a telephone number near the front door of blocks of flats that you can call in such a situation.
How do I sort my waste correctly?
In Finland, biowaste, cardboard, glass, metal, hazardous waste and mixed waste are sorted separately.

What should be taken into account when I use the sauna in my dwelling?

What do I do if a water tap leaks?
Call the building maintenance company that has an agreement with your building management company.
The building maintenance company can perform minor repairs, such as water tap repairs or unclogging a drain.
Problems with damp
There are problems with damp or other defects in my dwelling. What do I do?
Contact the building maintenance company, building manager or lessor immediately.
It is important to repair such defects quickly before they escalate.
When we cook, a lot of condensation collects in the kitchen.
What can we do?
If your home does not have mechanical ventilation, open windows for ventilation purposes.
This is especially important, if you notice that water vapour or condensation forms on the windows when you cook.
Use the exhaust hood when cooking.
Check that the exhaust vents are open.
If you cause damage to the dwelling, you must pay for it.

From where can I get help and advice on housing matters?
There are many places you can ask for advice on housing matters.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
In Finland, supported housing (tukiasuminen) and service housing (palveluasuminen) are available to those in need of support in living independently.
Supported and service housing are available to
the elderly
the disabled
the mentally disabled
those recovering from mental and drug abuse problems.
Supported and service housing are offered by municipalities, organisations and private entrepreneurs.
To apply for supported and service housing, contact your local social services (sosiaalivirasto).
Supported housing
A person living in supported housing copes with everyday tasks almost independently.
The amount of support depends on the needs of the resident.
It may vary from everyday to weekly visits.
Supported housing may refer to a dwelling owned by the resident, a rental dwelling or some other housing type.
The duration of supported housing depends on the resident’s own needs and situation in life.
The purpose is for the residents to organise their lives during supported housing well enough to be able to transfer to independent living.
Service housing
Service housing is a housing type meant for people who need constant help but not institutional care.
Service housing contains both the dwelling and housing-related services.
The resident accounts for the costs of housing him/herself.
Service housing can be organised in regular dwellings, service homes, service blocks or other housing forms.
A resident will live in his/her own dwelling and receive services for being able to live there.
Such services may include, for example, domestic aid, meal service, services related to personal hygiene, various security services and health care services.
Costs of service housing
The costs of service housing depend on who provides the service.
Service housing is offered both by municipalities and private companies.
There is great variation in the prices and services.
When applying for service housing, find out what exactly it costs.
It is advisable to compare service homes owned by the municipality and those in private ownership.
The resident pays for the accommodation and services him/herself if able to do so.
However, the municipality must ensure that the resident can afford living in a service home in cases where this service is needed.
In order to find out more about the different housing types, contact your local social services.
The elderly
Senior citizens in need of daily outside help and support are eligible for service housing.

A shared-ownership dwelling (osaomistusasunto) is a good way of obtaining your own dwelling if you cannot afford to buy one right away.
You will only own part of the dwelling at first and pay rent.
Afterwards, it is possible to buy the whole dwelling for yourself.
When you move into a shared-ownership dwelling, you first pay approximately 10–20 per cent of the price of the dwelling.
You can apply for a bank loan to pay this fee.
After this, you will live in the dwelling as a tenant and pay rent every month.
The tenancy period normally lasts around 5–12 years.
Meanwhile, you may be able to buy additional shares in the dwelling if you have agreed this with the constructor.
Once the tenancy period comes to an end, you can buy the dwelling for yourself.
After this, you will have a normal owner-occupied dwelling in a housing company.
Some shared-ownership dwellings are built based on a state subsidy.
In such a case, the law will determine, for example, the length of the tenancy period and the procedures for giving up the dwelling.
Finland also has privately financed shared-ownership dwellings (vapaarahoitteinen osaomistusasunto).
The construction of these dwellings is not subsidised by the state.
If you buy a privately financed shared-ownership dwelling, the tenancy period or other contractual terms are not regulated by law.
How can I get a shared-ownership dwelling?
Communities and companies that order the construction of shared-ownership dwellings provide information on new and vacant dwellings.
You can also obtain information on such dwellings from the municipal housing office.
You can apply for a shared-ownership dwelling from its constructor.
If a shared-ownership dwelling is constructed with a state subsidy, you can acquire it if
your income is not too high; and
you are not too wealthy.
If you apply for a privately financed shared-ownership dwelling, your income and wealth are not taken into account.

The housing allowance (asumistuki) granted by Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland), is meant for housing-related costs.
Kela’s housing allowance covers the housing costs only partly.
You are eligible to receive housing allowance if you have low income and you live in Finland permanently.
Living in Finland permanently means that you have an actual home in Finland and that you mainly live in Finland.
In order to receive housing allowance, you must be covered by Finnish social security.
Kela’s housing-related benefits include:
general housing allowance
housing allowance for pensioners
housing assistance for conscripts and civil service men
If your income is not enough for you to live on even though you receive a housing allowance, you can apply to Kela for income support.
Read more about income support on InfoFinland webpage Financial problems.
Financial aid for housingFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Kela’s general housing allowance
The allowance is available either for an individual person or a household (ruokakunta).
People permanently living in the same dwelling belong to the same household.
Normally, a household refers to a married couple, an unmarried couple living together or a family.
A single person may also constitute a household.
Housing allowance is granted to a household jointly, based on a single application.
Take into consideration that if you live in the same dwelling, for example with your friend, and you have a joint tenancy agreement, you will be considered as belonging to the same household.
Instead, if one of you is the main tenant and the other one is a subtenant, and you are not immediate family, you will be considered as belonging to different households.
General housing allowance is available to
families with children
students
unmarried couples living together
those living alone or
those living in a community
What kinds of housing costs are accepted?
Housing allowance can be granted for a permanent dwelling in Finland.
The law stipulates which housing costs can be accepted when calculating housing allowance.
The dwelling can be
a rental dwelling
an owner-occupied dwelling
a right-of-occupancy dwelling
a part-ownership dwelling
Benefit is granted for the rent, charge for use and the dwelling upkeep costs.
Such upkeep costs contain, for example, heating costs and water rates.
Also a part of mortgage interest is considered when calculating the housing allowance.
Housing allowance is granted for reasonable housing costs.
In big towns, higher housing costs are accepted than in smaller ones.
Kela will not pay for all housing costs
You need to pay part of your housing costs yourself.
A so-called basic deductible (perusomavastuu) is determined for this purpose.
The amount of the basic deductible depends on
the number of adults and children belonging to the household
the combined gross income in the household (income before taxes)
With very low incomes, no basic deductible needs to be paid.
When the amount of your housing allowance is calculated, EUR 300 of your earned income per month is excluded from the calculation.
This amount does not affect the amount of your housing allowance.
This amount is called the earned-income deduction (ansiotulovähennys).
The earned-income deduction is made separately for each member of the household.
Housing allowance is only granted for reasonable housing costs.
When assessing reasonable housing costs, the following is taken into consideration:
the municipality in which the dwelling is located
the number of adults and children belonging to the household
If your home is more expensive than the limit specified in the Housing Allowance Act, you will have to pay a greater share of your housing costs.
The final housing allowance is calculated as follows:
The basic deductible is first deducted from your housing costs.
The housing allowance is 80 per cent of the remainder.
Notify Kela of changes
If there are changes to your income, living arrangement, family situation or other circumstances, notify Kela about these changes without delay.
Kela’s decision provides detailed information on which changes to notify.

If you are a student, you can apply for rental housing that is particularly intended for students.
The rent of student housing is usually cheaper than other rental housing.
Student housing are leased by student housing foundations, student unions, student associations and some other foundations.
Some institutes also have their own student halls.
Ask from your own institute where you can apply for student housing.
You can apply for student housing as soon as you have received a study place.
In the larger cities it may take several weeks or months before you receive student housing.
If you are granted student housing, you can usually live there throughout your studies.
You must, however, be a fulltime student and make progress in your studies.
Your lessor may terminate your tenancy agreement if you have not completed enough courses.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, you can apply for a housing allowance from Kela to cover your housing costs.

You have the right to live in a right-of-occupancy dwelling when you first pay a right-of-occupancy payment (asumisoikeusasunto) for it.
The payment is approximately 15 per cent of the price of the dwelling.
If you cannot afford the right-of-occupancy payment yourself, you can obtain a loan from a bank.
You can deduct the loan interest from your taxation.
After that, you will pay a certain amount each month as a charge for use (käyttövastike).
The charge for use varies according to the dwelling and its location.
Under law, the charge for use may not exceed the level of rent paid for similar dwellings in the same area.
If you have a low income, you can apply for housing allowance in order to pay the charge for use.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Housing allowance.
You cannot buy a right-of-occupancy dwelling for yourself.
Why choose a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
A right-of-occupancy dwelling does not involve financial risks.
It is therefore a safer option than owner-occupied housing.
You do not need a large loan for a right-of-occupancy dwelling.
When you want to move out, you do not have to sell the dwelling.
You can live in a right-of-occupancy dwelling for as long as you want.
The house owner cannot terminate the right-of-occupancy contract.
This means that a right-of-occupancy dwelling is more permanent than a rental one.
You can also pass on your right of occupancy through inheritance.
Responsibilities of residents
If you have a right-of-occupancy dwelling, you must use it as your own permanent dwelling.
You can only rent it out to another person for two years at the most.
However, you need the permission of the house owner to do so.
Who can get a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
If the right-of-occupancy dwelling has not been constructed with a state subsidy, the house owner can choose the residents him/herself.
If the dwelling has been constructed with a state subsidy, you can apply to stay there if
you are 18 years of age or older
you do not own a dwelling in the same area
you do not have the funds to buy a dwelling in the same area.
However, your wealth is not taken into account if you are over 55 years of age or you are moving from one right-of-occupancy dwelling into another.
Sometimes, there can also be other conditions.
How to apply for a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
Right-of-occupancy dwellings are available in the biggest Finnish municipalities.
If you want a right-of-occupancy dwelling, you need to get a queue number from the housing office of the municipality.
You can get queue numbers from several municipalities.
Getting a queue number will not cost you anything.
You are not obliged to apply for a dwelling even if you have a queue number.
Next, you need to choose the house from which you want a right-of-occupancy dwelling.
Then report to the house owner.
Let him/her also know what kind of dwelling you are looking for.
You can apply for right-of-occupancy dwellings from several house owners.
You may have to wait a long time for the dwelling to become vacant.
Right-of-occupancy contract
When you get a dwelling, you must sign a written right-of-occupancy contract (asumisoikeussopimus) with the house owner.
The right-of-occupancy contract will state the amount of the right-of-occupancy payment, the charge for use and other possible terms.
You can move in once you have signed the right-of-occupancy contract and paid the right-of-occupancy payment.
Moving out
If you want to give up your dwelling, you need to deliver a corresponding notification (luopumisilmoitus) to the house owner.
Once you have given up the dwelling, the right-of-occupancy payment will be refunded to you.

Most Finns live in dwellings they own.
There are other alternatives, in addition to owner-occupied dwelling and rental dwelling.
Read more on the InfoFinland pages Right-of-occupancy home and Shared-ownership home.
Housing share and real estate
When you buy a dwelling, you either purchase a housing share (asunto-osake) or real estate (kiinteistö).
Housing shares are dwellings in either blocks of flats or terraced houses.
These houses are owned by housing companies.
When you buy a detached house, you buy real estate.
Real estate usually comprises a detached house and the related plot.
Where to find owner-occupied housing?
When looking for a dwelling, you should prepare for up to several months of searching.
Dwellings are sold by private persons, real estate agencies and housing constructors.
Adverts for available dwellings can be found online and in newspapers, for example.
Once you find a dwelling that interests you, book a time with the seller to go and see it.
Sometimes the adverts indicate a time when you can go and see the dwelling.
In such cases, you do not need to book a time in advance.

Find out about the condition of the dwelling and other matters
Once you have found a dwelling that you like, gather all of the relevant information on it.
In particular, you should find out about the condition of the dwelling.
If you are about to buy a housing share, find out if any renovations are planned in the housing company, and if yes, what the related costs will be.
For example, a plumbing renovation can cost the owner-occupier tens of thousands of euros.
Responsibilities of seller and buyer in dwelling sales
The seller of a dwelling is held responsible for any defects in the dwelling for some time after the sale.
The seller’s responsibility for defects usually lasts for two years in the case of housing shares.
In the case of real estate, the seller’s responsibility lasts for five years.
By law, the seller of a dwelling must notify the buyer of any known defects in the dwelling before the sale.
If it is clear that the seller has known about a defect in the dwelling, but has failed to inform the buyer of it, the seller may be obliged to pay compensation to the buyer.
Before you buy a dwelling, inspect it for any defects.
You cannot demand compensation for a defect afterwards if
you should have noticed the defect when inspecting the dwelling; or
you were aware of the defect before buying the dwelling.
The dwelling may also have hidden defects.
This refers to damage of which no one is aware.
Hidden defects often include water damage, for example.
If the dwelling has a serious defect which, if known, would have affected the sale of the dwelling, the seller is obliged to pay compensation to the buyer.
Mortgage
Most people finance their dwelling purchases with a mortgage (asuntolaina).
Anyone can apply for a mortgage from a bank.
In order to be granted a mortgage, your income needs to be at a level that allows you to repay the loan without problems.
Many banks have mortgage calculators on their website.
These allow you to make advance assessments of whether or not you would be able to repay the mortgage.
If you are unsure about whether a bank will grant you a mortgage, it is advisable to visit a bank and negotiate the loan well before buying a dwelling.
Mortgages are repaid, i.e., instalments are paid off, once a month.
In addition, you must pay the bank interest (korko) on the loan.
You can ask for offers from several banks and compare them.
Different mortgages have different conditions.
When you consider different mortgage alternatives, take account of the following:
What is the interest rate on the mortgage?
What is the amount that you must pay back every month?
How many years will it take to pay off your mortgage?
Bear in mind that if interest rates rise, the cost of your mortgage will also increase.
In that event, the monthly payment to the bank will increase or the loan period will extend.
You can have some of the mortgage interest deducted against tax.
linkkiFinnish Competition and Consumer Authority:
Information on mortgageFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Mortgage collaterals and securities
A mortgage usually requires collateral (vakuus).
The dwelling that you will buy usually covers about 70 per cent of the mortgage.
In addition to that, you need collateral for the remaining amount of the mortgage.
You can arrange collateral by, for example,
The state guarantee covers up to 20 per cent of the mortgage and not more than 50,000 euros in total.
Asking one of your relatives or friends to secure the loan.
If you are unable to repay the mortgage to the bank, the guarantor will have to pay the amount of mortgage he/she has secured.
However, you will not need guarantors for your loan if you have saved up part of the price of the dwelling in advance, or if you have property that can be accepted as collateral for the mortgage.

Support for buying a dwelling

Interest subsidy is granted to young people buying their first dwelling.
It is also granted to those buying or building a detached house.

Transfer tax
When buying a dwelling, you also need to pay transfer tax (varainsiirtovero).
If you buy a housing share, the transfer tax is 2 per cent of the debt-free price of the dwelling.
If you buy real estate, the transfer tax is 4 per cent of the debt-free price of the dwelling.
However, you will not need to pay transfer tax if all of the following conditions are met:
you are 18–39 years old
you have not previously owned a dwelling in Finland or another country
you own at least 50 per cent of the dwelling
you use the dwelling as your own permanent home.
linkkiTax Administration:
First-time homebuyers’ exemption from transfer taxFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Bidding
When you are sure that you want and can buy a dwelling, you can make a bid for it.
It is advisable to make the bid in writing.
The bidding price can be, for example, 5–10 per cent less than the seller is asking for the dwelling.
However, the seller may not always be willing to lower the price that he/she has asked for.
A bid is binding.
This means that you cannot cancel your bid.
If you cancel a bid, you may need to pay a fine or the down payment to the seller.
The amount usually equals a few per cent of the price of the dwelling.
Information on prices of dwellings soldFinnish _ Swedish
Buying a dwelling
If the seller of the dwelling accepts the bid, the agreement is signed in the buyer’s bank.
Those present usually include the buyer, the seller and the real estate agent if one was used.
A sales contract is an agreement specifying, for example, the size, price and condition of the dwelling as well as the day on which the buyer gains possession of the dwelling.
The sales contract is usually prepared by the bank or the real estate agent.
The buyer has the right to familiarise him/herself with the contents of the sales contract before the signing date.
The bank grants a mortgage to the buyer and the mortgage amount is transferred to the seller's bank account.
Down payment
A down payment (käsiraha) is an advance payment on the dwelling.
The buyer can pay a down payment to the seller at the sale preparation stage.
A down payment is usually around three per cent of the price of the dwelling.
If your own savings are insufficient for making the down payment, you can borrow it from the bank as part of your mortgage.
Costs of owner-occupied dwelling
Your cost of living depends on the following:
the amount of your mortgage
the size of your dwelling
the condition of your dwelling
the location of your dwelling.
Housing share
If you own a housing share, you usually pay
repayments and interest on your mortgage
charge for financial costs (rahoitusvastike) if the housing company holds debt
water rates and electricity charges
possible repairs.

Supported housing
A person living in supported housing copes with everyday tasks almost independently.
The amount of support depends on the needs of the resident.
It may vary from everyday to weekly visits.
Supported housing may refer to a dwelling owned by the resident, a rental dwelling or some other housing type.
The duration of supported housing depends on the resident’s own needs and situation in life.
The purpose is for the residents to organise their lives during supported housing well enough to be able to transfer to independent living.
Service housing
Service housing is a housing type meant for people who need constant help but not institutional care.
Service housing contains both the dwelling and housing-related services.
The resident accounts for the costs of housing him/herself.
Service housing can be organised in regular dwellings, service homes, service blocks or other housing forms.
A resident will live in his/her own dwelling and receive services for being able to live there.
Such services may include, for example, domestic aid, meal service, services related to personal hygiene, various security services and health care services.
Costs of service housing
The costs of service housing depend on who provides the service.
Service housing is offered both by municipalities and private companies.
There is great variation in the prices and services.
When applying for service housing, find out what exactly it costs.
It is advisable to compare service homes owned by the municipality and those in private ownership.
The resident pays for the accommodation and services him/herself if able to do so.
However, the municipality must ensure that the resident can afford living in a service home in cases where this service is needed.
In order to find out more about the different housing types, contact your local social services.

The term of housing may be anything from a day to several months.
Short-term rental dwellings are usually furnished.
The amount of rent varies according to the location of the dwelling.
Prices will be higher in the central areas of towns.
Homelike apartment hotels with their own kitchens, for example, are also available.
The average price of such an apartment is usually 100 euros a day.
If you live in the apartment longer, for several weeks, for example, the price may be lower.

The prices of hotels also vary a lot depending on the season and the location of the hotel.
On average, a single or double hotel room costs 60–100 euros a day.
Accommodation in a hostel is cheaper than in a hotel, but the service level is more modest and it is not always possible to get your own room.

It is cheapest to stay in a shared room.
Hotels in FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Chinese
Home accommodation
You can also stay at regular Finns’ homes as their guest.

There are two kinds of tenancy agreements:
tenancy agreements that are valid until further notice
fixed-term tenancy agreements.
A tenancy agreement that is valid until further notice (toistaiseksi voimassa oleva vuokrasopimus) will only end once either the tenant or the landlord terminates it.
If you do not know in advance how long you will stay in the dwelling, this kind of agreement is a good alternative.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement (määräaikainen vuokrasopimus) means that the tenant and the landlord agree upon conclusion of the tenancy agreement when the agreement will end.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement will automatically end on the date specified in the agreement without separate notice.
If you wish to continue staying in the dwelling after this, you need to make a new tenancy agreement.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement cannot be terminated during its validity period.
This applies to both the tenant and the landlord.
If you know in advance that you will only need the dwelling for a specific period of time, a fixed-term tenancy agreement is a good alternative.
Payment of rent
Rents are usually paid once a month.
The rent must be paid by the latest on the due date.
The due date is specified in the tenancy agreement.
Pay the rent as a bank transfer to the landlord’s bank account.
You cannot pay rent with a credit card.
Rent security deposit
In Finland, almost all tenancy agreements require that you pay a rent security deposit.
This means that you pay the landlord in advance a sum of money that equals a few months rent.
The rent security deposit usually equals two months' rent.
The deposit can be worth three months' rent at the most.
Pay the rent security deposit to the landlord by the date agreed in the tenancy agreement.
Usually, you get keys to the dwelling once you have paid the rent security deposit.
Once the tenancy agreement ends, a final inspection is made in the dwelling.
The landlord will return the whole rent security deposit to you if
you have kept the dwelling in good condition and
you have made all the payments agreed with the landlord.
If, however, you have broken something in the dwelling or failed to pay enough rent, the landlord will not return the whole rent security deposit.
The rent security deposit cannot be used to pay the last months rents.
Other payments
In addition to rent, you should reserve money for other expenses, too.
Water
The tenant is usually required to pay a water rate.
Pay the water rate in connection with the rent, either to the landlord or the housing company.
The water rate is often determined according to the number of residents in the dwelling.
If the dwelling has a water meter, the amount of water rate depends on how much water you use.
Electricity
You will usually need to sign an electricity contract with an electricity provider yourself.
You can obtain an electricity contract by calling an electricity company and supplying them with your name and new address.
You can compare the prices offered by different electricity companies if you wish to find the cheapest one.
Heating
If the dwelling has central heating, it is usually included in the rent.
If the dwelling has oil or electric heating, it sometimes needs to be paid separately.
Sauna, laundry room and parking space
If you wish to use the housing company's sauna, laundry room or parking space, this is usually subject to a fee.
These fees are usually paid directly to the housing company.
Payments in a detached house
If you are a tenant in a detached house, you often have to pay for the heating and waste management, too.
Termination of tenancy agreement
The notice period refers to the period of time in which the agreement remains in force after a notice of termination has been given.
The notice period applies to a tenancy agreement that is valid until further notice.
For a tenant, the notice period is always one calendar month.
Remember to consider how the notice period is calculated.
Usually, the notice period does not begin until the end of the month during which the notice has been given.
For example, if you want to move out on 1 December, it is advisable to give notice on 31 October at the latest.
Otherwise, you will also need to pay rent for December.
Always make the notice of termination in writing.
You must be able to prove that you have given the notice to the landlord.
For a landlord, the length of the notice period depends on how long the tenancy agreement has been in force.
If the tenancy agreement has been in effect for less than a year, the notice period is three months.
If the tenancy agreement has been in effect for more than a year, the notice period is six months.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement cannot be terminated during its validity period.
Sub-leasing
Sub-leasing means that a tenant rents out part of the dwelling to another person.
The tenant has the right to do so if this does not cause significant harm to the dwelling’s actual landlord.
When planning sub-tenancy, make sure that the primary tenant has the right to take sub-tenants.
You are also considered a sub-tenant in case you have only rented part of a dwelling and the owner him/herself lives in the same dwelling.
A sub-tenant's notice period is shorter than that of the primary tenant.
Secondary leasing
Secondary leasing means that a tenant leases an entire dwelling to another person.
This always requires permission from the landlord.
A secondary tenant has the same termination procedure as the primary tenant.

If you do not have permanent housing, and you are not officially a tenant or a subtenant, you are considered homeless.
In Finland, municipalities offer services for the homeless.
These services are intended for those who have a municipality of residence in Finland.
If you become homeless, contact the social services office or social clinic of your municipality of residence.
They will help you when you are looking for a flat or temporary housing.
Temporary housing could be in a dorm, a night shelter or a flat intended for the homeless.
Go over your situation with a social worker: how much rent you are able to pay, and whether you are eligible for any financial aid for your rent.
You can also ask for advice from the guidance service for immigrants provided by your municipality of residence.
You can find information on finding rental accommodation on the InfoFinland page Rental dwelling.
The housing situation varies greatly depending on the location.
For example, there are vacant flats in many of the smaller municipalities around Finland.
It may be difficult to find a flat in the metropolitan area.
You can also ask for advice and assistance from the association called Vailla vakinaista asuntoa.
It is an association that offers advice, support and guidance in housing-related matters and aims to improve the status of the homeless in society.
Ohjaamo guidance centres offer advice and guidance for young homeless people.
Association for the homelessFinnish
If you do not live in Finland permanently
If you do not live in Finland permanently and you become homeless, please contact the embassy of your country in Finland.

Vailla vakinaista asuntoa maintains a night café called Kalkkers that offers a warm place to spend the night for the homeless from the autumn to the spring.
Kalkkers is open from 22.00 to 06.00.
There are no places for sleeping at the centre, and it is not an alcohol and drug-free facility.
They will not ask you whether you have a residence permit or not.
The centre is located in Helsinki at Vaasankatu 5, and the telephone number is 050 443 1068.

A shared-ownership dwelling (osaomistusasunto) is a good way of obtaining your own dwelling if you cannot afford to buy one right away.
You will only own part of the dwelling at first and pay rent.
Afterwards, it is possible to buy the whole dwelling for yourself.
When you move into a shared-ownership dwelling, you first pay approximately 10–20 per cent of the price of the dwelling.
You can apply for a bank loan to pay this fee.
After this, you will live in the dwelling as a tenant and pay rent every month.
The tenancy period normally lasts around 5–12 years.
Meanwhile, you may be able to buy additional shares in the dwelling if you have agreed this with the constructor.
Once the tenancy period comes to an end, you can buy the dwelling for yourself.
After this, you will have a normal owner-occupied dwelling in a housing company.
Some shared-ownership dwellings are built based on a state subsidy.
In such a case, the law will determine, for example, the length of the tenancy period and the procedures for giving up the dwelling.
Finland also has privately financed shared-ownership dwellings (vapaarahoitteinen osaomistusasunto).
The construction of these dwellings is not subsidised by the state.
If you buy a privately financed shared-ownership dwelling, the tenancy period or other contractual terms are not regulated by law.
How can I get a shared-ownership dwelling?
Communities and companies that order the construction of shared-ownership dwellings provide information on new and vacant dwellings.
You can also obtain information on such dwellings from the municipal housing office.
You can apply for a shared-ownership dwelling from its constructor.
If a shared-ownership dwelling is constructed with a state subsidy, you can acquire it if
your income is not too high; and
you are not too wealthy.
If you apply for a privately financed shared-ownership dwelling, your income and wealth are not taken into account.

In Finland, many people live in rental housing.
The upside of renting is that switching flats is easy, as you do not have to sell your old home and buy a new one.
On the other hand, your landlord may decide to terminate your lease if he or she has an acceptable reason for doing so.
In such an eventuality, you will be forced to move out of your flat even if you would not wish to.
There is important information on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement about giving notice, paying rent, the deposit and other costs in a rental dwelling.
It is often difficult to find a suitable flat for rent in the largest cities, where the rents are also higher.
Reserve enough time for finding a flat.
Some areas are extremely popular and any vacant flats are rented very quickly.
When you have found a suitable place, you should quickly decide whether to rent it or not.
According to Finnish law, a landlord choosing a tenant must not discriminate against anyone on the basis of factors such as ethnic origin, religion or nationality.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Discrimination and racism.
How can I get a rental flat?
You can look for advertisements online.
Use ”vuokra-asunto” as the search term.
Flats are also often advertised in local newspapers.
Search for rental dwellingsFinnish _ English

Private rental housing
You can usually find a privately rented flat quicker than a municipal one, but the rent will generally be higher.
You do not need to use an agent to look for a flat.
You can look for information on vacant flats yourself.
In that case you do not need to pay a commission (välityspalkkio).
You can look for private rental flats online and in local newspapers.
You can also publish your own wanted ad.
If you wish to rent a private flat, contact the landlord to agree on a date to inspect the flat.
Showings are usually arranged for all interested parties simultaneously.
At the showing, you will be given an application form.
Complete the form if you are interested in renting the flat.
If you wish to have an agent look for a suitable rental flat, you must make an assignment agreement (toimeksiantosopimus) in writing with the agent.
In this case you will have to pay a commission to the agent.
Agree on the commission in writing in advance.
The commission could be, for example, a month’s rent.
Compare the commissions of various agencies in advance.
If you rent a private flat, sign a lease with the landlord.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Rental agreements.
Prices of privately-financed rental housingEnglish
Municipal rental housing
Many municipalities own rental flats, and these are often more affordable than privately rented ones.
You can apply for state-subsidised rental housing if you have one of the following:
Finnish citizenship;
a registered right of residence;
a residence permit card;
a residence permit which is valid for at least 12 months; or
a student’s residence permit.
If you would like to apply for a municipal rental flat, complete the application form at your municipality's housing agency.
Many municipalities also offer online forms on their websites.
In some municipalities, rental flats are so sought-after that you will be forced to wait a very long time for a home.
For example, in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa), housing queues are long. Meanwhile, many smaller municipalities in various parts of Finland have vacant apartments.
The following factors are taken into account when choosing tenants:
income
assets
housing requirement
Many non-profit organisations offer affordable rental housing in Finland.

You have the right to live in a right-of-occupancy dwelling when you first pay a right-of-occupancy payment (asumisoikeusasunto) for it.
The payment is approximately 15 per cent of the price of the dwelling.
If you cannot afford the right-of-occupancy payment yourself, you can obtain a loan from a bank.
You can deduct the loan interest from your taxation.
After that, you will pay a certain amount each month as a charge for use (käyttövastike).
The charge for use varies according to the dwelling and its location.
Under law, the charge for use may not exceed the level of rent paid for similar dwellings in the same area.
If you have a low income, you can apply for housing allowance in order to pay the charge for use.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Housing allowance.
You cannot buy a right-of-occupancy dwelling for yourself.
Why choose a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
A right-of-occupancy dwelling does not involve financial risks.
It is therefore a safer option than owner-occupied housing.
You do not need a large loan for a right-of-occupancy dwelling.
When you want to move out, you do not have to sell the dwelling.
You can live in a right-of-occupancy dwelling for as long as you want.
The house owner cannot terminate the right-of-occupancy contract.
This means that a right-of-occupancy dwelling is more permanent than a rental one.
You can also pass on your right of occupancy through inheritance.
Responsibilities of residents
If you have a right-of-occupancy dwelling, you must use it as your own permanent dwelling.
You can only rent it out to another person for two years at the most.
However, you need the permission of the house owner to do so.
Who can get a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
If the right-of-occupancy dwelling has not been constructed with a state subsidy, the house owner can choose the residents him/herself.
If the dwelling has been constructed with a state subsidy, you can apply to stay there if
you are 18 years of age or older
you do not own a dwelling in the same area
you do not have the funds to buy a dwelling in the same area.
However, your wealth is not taken into account if you are over 55 years of age or you are moving from one right-of-occupancy dwelling into another.
Sometimes, there can also be other conditions.
How to apply for a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
Right-of-occupancy dwellings are available in the biggest Finnish municipalities.
If you want a right-of-occupancy dwelling, you need to get a queue number from the housing office of the municipality.
You can get queue numbers from several municipalities.
Getting a queue number will not cost you anything.
You are not obliged to apply for a dwelling even if you have a queue number.
Next, you need to choose the house from which you want a right-of-occupancy dwelling.
Then report to the house owner.
Let him/her also know what kind of dwelling you are looking for.
You can apply for right-of-occupancy dwellings from several house owners.
You may have to wait a long time for the dwelling to become vacant.
Right-of-occupancy contract
When you get a dwelling, you must sign a written right-of-occupancy contract (asumisoikeussopimus) with the house owner.
The right-of-occupancy contract will state the amount of the right-of-occupancy payment, the charge for use and other possible terms.
You can move in once you have signed the right-of-occupancy contract and paid the right-of-occupancy payment.
Moving out
If you want to give up your dwelling, you need to deliver a corresponding notification (luopumisilmoitus) to the house owner.
Once you have given up the dwelling, the right-of-occupancy payment will be refunded to you.

Check the term of notice for your dwelling.
It is usually a calendar month.

Most Finns live in dwellings they own.
There are other alternatives, in addition to owner-occupied dwelling and rental dwelling.
Read more on the InfoFinland pages Right-of-occupancy home and Shared-ownership home.
Housing share and real estate
When you buy a dwelling, you either purchase a housing share (asunto-osake) or real estate (kiinteistö).
Housing shares are dwellings in either blocks of flats or terraced houses.
These houses are owned by housing companies.
When you buy a detached house, you buy real estate.
Real estate usually comprises a detached house and the related plot.
Where to find owner-occupied housing?
When looking for a dwelling, you should prepare for up to several months of searching.
Dwellings are sold by private persons, real estate agencies and housing constructors.
Adverts for available dwellings can be found online and in newspapers, for example.
Once you find a dwelling that interests you, book a time with the seller to go and see it.
Sometimes the adverts indicate a time when you can go and see the dwelling.
In such cases, you do not need to book a time in advance.

Information on buying a homeFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Find out about the condition of the dwelling and other matters
Once you have found a dwelling that you like, gather all of the relevant information on it.
In particular, you should find out about the condition of the dwelling.
If you are about to buy a housing share, find out if any renovations are planned in the housing company, and if yes, what the related costs will be.
For example, a plumbing renovation can cost the owner-occupier tens of thousands of euros.
Responsibilities of seller and buyer in dwelling sales
The seller of a dwelling is held responsible for any defects in the dwelling for some time after the sale.
The seller’s responsibility for defects usually lasts for two years in the case of housing shares.
In the case of real estate, the seller’s responsibility lasts for five years.
By law, the seller of a dwelling must notify the buyer of any known defects in the dwelling before the sale.
If it is clear that the seller has known about a defect in the dwelling, but has failed to inform the buyer of it, the seller may be obliged to pay compensation to the buyer.
Before you buy a dwelling, inspect it for any defects.
You cannot demand compensation for a defect afterwards if
you should have noticed the defect when inspecting the dwelling; or
you were aware of the defect before buying the dwelling.
The dwelling may also have hidden defects.
This refers to damage of which no one is aware.
Hidden defects often include water damage, for example.
If the dwelling has a serious defect which, if known, would have affected the sale of the dwelling, the seller is obliged to pay compensation to the buyer.
Mortgage
Most people finance their dwelling purchases with a mortgage (asuntolaina).
Anyone can apply for a mortgage from a bank.
In order to be granted a mortgage, your income needs to be at a level that allows you to repay the loan without problems.
Many banks have mortgage calculators on their website.
These allow you to make advance assessments of whether or not you would be able to repay the mortgage.
If you are unsure about whether a bank will grant you a mortgage, it is advisable to visit a bank and negotiate the loan well before buying a dwelling.
Mortgages are repaid, i.e., instalments are paid off, once a month.
In addition, you must pay the bank interest (korko) on the loan.
You can ask for offers from several banks and compare them.
Different mortgages have different conditions.
When you consider different mortgage alternatives, take account of the following:
What is the interest rate on the mortgage?
What is the amount that you must pay back every month?
How many years will it take to pay off your mortgage?
Bear in mind that if interest rates rise, the cost of your mortgage will also increase.
In that event, the monthly payment to the bank will increase or the loan period will extend.
You can have some of the mortgage interest deducted against tax.
linkkiFinnish Competition and Consumer Authority:
Information on mortgageFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Mortgage collaterals and securities
A mortgage usually requires collateral (vakuus).
The dwelling that you will buy usually covers about 70 per cent of the mortgage.
In addition to that, you need collateral for the remaining amount of the mortgage.
You can arrange collateral by, for example,
The state guarantee covers up to 20 per cent of the mortgage and not more than 50,000 euros in total.
Asking one of your relatives or friends to secure the loan.
If you are unable to repay the mortgage to the bank, the guarantor will have to pay the amount of mortgage he/she has secured.
However, you will not need guarantors for your loan if you have saved up part of the price of the dwelling in advance, or if you have property that can be accepted as collateral for the mortgage.
linkkiMinistry of the Environment:
Information on state guarantees for mortgagesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Support for buying a dwelling
The state grants interest subsidy (korkotuki) on mortgages.
Interest subsidy is granted to young people buying their first dwelling.
It is also granted to those buying or building a detached house.
Read more on the Ministry of the Environment's website.
linkkiMinistry of the Environment:
Information on interest subsidyFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Transfer tax
When buying a dwelling, you also need to pay transfer tax (varainsiirtovero).
If you buy a housing share, the transfer tax is 2 per cent of the debt-free price of the dwelling.
If you buy real estate, the transfer tax is 4 per cent of the debt-free price of the dwelling.
However, you will not need to pay transfer tax if all of the following conditions are met:
you are 18–39 years old
you have not previously owned a dwelling in Finland or another country
you own at least 50 per cent of the dwelling
you use the dwelling as your own permanent home.
linkkiTax Administration:
First-time homebuyers’ exemption from transfer taxFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Bidding
When you are sure that you want and can buy a dwelling, you can make a bid for it.
It is advisable to make the bid in writing.
The bidding price can be, for example, 5–10 per cent less than the seller is asking for the dwelling.
However, the seller may not always be willing to lower the price that he/she has asked for.
A bid is binding.
This means that you cannot cancel your bid.
If you cancel a bid, you may need to pay a fine or the down payment to the seller.
The amount usually equals a few per cent of the price of the dwelling.
Information on prices of dwellings soldFinnish _ Swedish
Buying a dwelling
If the seller of the dwelling accepts the bid, the agreement is signed in the buyer’s bank.
Those present usually include the buyer, the seller and the real estate agent if one was used.
A sales contract is an agreement specifying, for example, the size, price and condition of the dwelling as well as the day on which the buyer gains possession of the dwelling.
The sales contract is usually prepared by the bank or the real estate agent.
The buyer has the right to familiarise him/herself with the contents of the sales contract before the signing date.
The bank grants a mortgage to the buyer and the mortgage amount is transferred to the seller's bank account.
Down payment
A down payment (käsiraha) is an advance payment on the dwelling.
The buyer can pay a down payment to the seller at the sale preparation stage.
A down payment is usually around three per cent of the price of the dwelling.
If your own savings are insufficient for making the down payment, you can borrow it from the bank as part of your mortgage.
Costs of owner-occupied dwelling
Your cost of living depends on the following:
the amount of your mortgage
the size of your dwelling
the condition of your dwelling
the location of your dwelling.
Housing share
If you own a housing share, you usually pay
repayments and interest on your mortgage
charge for financial costs (rahoitusvastike) if the housing company holds debt
water rates and electricity charges
possible repairs.
Real estate
If you own real estate, you usually pay
repayments and interest on your mortgage
real estate tax (kiinteistövero)
water rates and electricity charges
heating costs
waste collection fees
possible repairs.
Domestic waste

Furnished rental dwellings and apartment hotels
Real estate agencies and private persons also rent out dwellings for short periods of time.
The term of housing may be anything from a day to several months.
Short-term rental dwellings are usually furnished.
The amount of rent varies according to the location of the dwelling.
Prices will be higher in the central areas of towns.
Homelike apartment hotels with their own kitchens, for example, are also available.
The average price of such an apartment is usually 100 euros a day.
If you live in the apartment longer, for several weeks, for example, the price may be lower.

Hotels and hostels
Living in a hotel is somewhat more expensive in Finland than it is in most European countries.
The prices of hotels also vary a lot depending on the season and the location of the hotel.
On average, a single or double hotel room costs 60–100 euros a day.
Accommodation in a hostel is cheaper than in a hotel, but the service level is more modest and it is not always possible to get your own room.
The price for a night is approximately 20–50 euros.
It is cheapest to stay in a shared room.
Hotels in FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Chinese
Home accommodation

There are two kinds of tenancy agreements:
tenancy agreements that are valid until further notice
fixed-term tenancy agreements.
A tenancy agreement that is valid until further notice (toistaiseksi voimassa oleva vuokrasopimus) will only end once either the tenant or the landlord terminates it.
If you do not know in advance how long you will stay in the dwelling, this kind of agreement is a good alternative.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement (määräaikainen vuokrasopimus) means that the tenant and the landlord agree upon conclusion of the tenancy agreement when the agreement will end.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement will automatically end on the date specified in the agreement without separate notice.
If you wish to continue staying in the dwelling after this, you need to make a new tenancy agreement.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement cannot be terminated during its validity period.
This applies to both the tenant and the landlord.
If you know in advance that you will only need the dwelling for a specific period of time, a fixed-term tenancy agreement is a good alternative.
Payment of rent
Rents are usually paid once a month.
The rent must be paid by the latest on the due date.
The due date is specified in the tenancy agreement.
Pay the rent as a bank transfer to the landlord’s bank account.
You cannot pay rent with a credit card.
Rent security deposit
In Finland, almost all tenancy agreements require that you pay a rent security deposit.
This means that you pay the landlord in advance a sum of money that equals a few months rent.
The rent security deposit usually equals two months' rent.
The deposit can be worth three months' rent at the most.
Pay the rent security deposit to the landlord by the date agreed in the tenancy agreement.
Usually, you get keys to the dwelling once you have paid the rent security deposit.
Once the tenancy agreement ends, a final inspection is made in the dwelling.
The landlord will return the whole rent security deposit to you if
you have kept the dwelling in good condition and
you have made all the payments agreed with the landlord.
If, however, you have broken something in the dwelling or failed to pay enough rent, the landlord will not return the whole rent security deposit.
The rent security deposit cannot be used to pay the last months rents.
Other payments
In addition to rent, you should reserve money for other expenses, too.
Water
The tenant is usually required to pay a water rate.
Pay the water rate in connection with the rent, either to the landlord or the housing company.
The water rate is often determined according to the number of residents in the dwelling.
If the dwelling has a water meter, the amount of water rate depends on how much water you use.
Electricity
You will usually need to sign an electricity contract with an electricity provider yourself.
You can obtain an electricity contract by calling an electricity company and supplying them with your name and new address.
You can compare the prices offered by different electricity companies if you wish to find the cheapest one.
Heating
If the dwelling has central heating, it is usually included in the rent.
If the dwelling has oil or electric heating, it sometimes needs to be paid separately.
Sauna, laundry room and parking space
If you wish to use the housing company's sauna, laundry room or parking space, this is usually subject to a fee.
These fees are usually paid directly to the housing company.
Payments in a detached house
If you are a tenant in a detached house, you often have to pay for the heating and waste management, too.
Termination of tenancy agreement
The notice period refers to the period of time in which the agreement remains in force after a notice of termination has been given.
The notice period applies to a tenancy agreement that is valid until further notice.
For a tenant, the notice period is always one calendar month.
Remember to consider how the notice period is calculated.
Usually, the notice period does not begin until the end of the month during which the notice has been given.
For example, if you want to move out on 1 December, it is advisable to give notice on 31 October at the latest.
Otherwise, you will also need to pay rent for December.
Always make the notice of termination in writing.
You must be able to prove that you have given the notice to the landlord.
For a landlord, the length of the notice period depends on how long the tenancy agreement has been in force.
If the tenancy agreement has been in effect for less than a year, the notice period is three months.
If the tenancy agreement has been in effect for more than a year, the notice period is six months.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement cannot be terminated during its validity period.
Sub-leasing
Sub-leasing means that a tenant rents out part of the dwelling to another person.
The tenant has the right to do so if this does not cause significant harm to the dwelling’s actual landlord.
When planning sub-tenancy, make sure that the primary tenant has the right to take sub-tenants.
You are also considered a sub-tenant in case you have only rented part of a dwelling and the owner him/herself lives in the same dwelling.
A sub-tenant's notice period is shorter than that of the primary tenant.
Secondary leasing
Secondary leasing means that a tenant leases an entire dwelling to another person.
This always requires permission from the landlord.
A secondary tenant has the same termination procedure as the primary tenant.

A shared-ownership dwelling (osaomistusasunto) is a good way of obtaining your own dwelling if you cannot afford to buy one right away.
You will only own part of the dwelling at first and pay rent.
Afterwards, it is possible to buy the whole dwelling for yourself.
When you move into a shared-ownership dwelling, you first pay approximately 10–20 per cent of the price of the dwelling.
You can apply for a bank loan to pay this fee.
After this, you will live in the dwelling as a tenant and pay rent every month.
The tenancy period normally lasts around 5–12 years.
Meanwhile, you may be able to buy additional shares in the dwelling if you have agreed this with the constructor.
Once the tenancy period comes to an end, you can buy the dwelling for yourself.
After this, you will have a normal owner-occupied dwelling in a housing company.
Some shared-ownership dwellings are built based on a state subsidy.
In such a case, the law will determine, for example, the length of the tenancy period and the procedures for giving up the dwelling.
Finland also has privately financed shared-ownership dwellings (vapaarahoitteinen osaomistusasunto).
The construction of these dwellings is not subsidised by the state.
If you buy a privately financed shared-ownership dwelling, the tenancy period or other contractual terms are not regulated by law.
How can I get a shared-ownership dwelling?
Communities and companies that order the construction of shared-ownership dwellings provide information on new and vacant dwellings.
You can also obtain information on such dwellings from the municipal housing office.
You can apply for a shared-ownership dwelling from its constructor.
If a shared-ownership dwelling is constructed with a state subsidy, you can acquire it if
your income is not too high; and
you are not too wealthy.
If you apply for a privately financed shared-ownership dwelling, your income and wealth are not taken into account.

In Finland, many people live in rental housing.
The upside of renting is that switching flats is easy, as you do not have to sell your old home and buy a new one.
On the other hand, your landlord may decide to terminate your lease if he or she has an acceptable reason for doing so.
In such an eventuality, you will be forced to move out of your flat even if you would not wish to.
There is important information on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement about giving notice, paying rent, the deposit and other costs in a rental dwelling.
It is often difficult to find a suitable flat for rent in the largest cities, where the rents are also higher.
Reserve enough time for finding a flat.
Some areas are extremely popular and any vacant flats are rented very quickly.
When you have found a suitable place, you should quickly decide whether to rent it or not.
According to Finnish law, a landlord choosing a tenant must not discriminate against anyone on the basis of factors such as ethnic origin, religion or nationality.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Discrimination and racism.
How can I get a rental flat?
You can look for advertisements online.
Use ”vuokra-asunto” as the search term.
Flats are also often advertised in local newspapers.
Search for rental dwellingsFinnish _ English
Search for rental dwellingsFinnish
Private rental housing
You can usually find a privately rented flat quicker than a municipal one, but the rent will generally be higher.
You do not need to use an agent to look for a flat.
You can look for information on vacant flats yourself.
In that case you do not need to pay a commission (välityspalkkio).
You can look for private rental flats online and in local newspapers.
You can also publish your own wanted ad.
If you wish to rent a private flat, contact the landlord to agree on a date to inspect the flat.
Showings are usually arranged for all interested parties simultaneously.
At the showing, you will be given an application form.
Complete the form if you are interested in renting the flat.
If you wish to have an agent look for a suitable rental flat, you must make an assignment agreement (toimeksiantosopimus) in writing with the agent.
In this case you will have to pay a commission to the agent.
Agree on the commission in writing in advance.
The commission could be, for example, a month’s rent.
Compare the commissions of various agencies in advance.
If you rent a private flat, sign a lease with the landlord.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Rental agreements.
Prices of privately-financed rental housingEnglish
Municipal rental housing
Many municipalities own rental flats, and these are often more affordable than privately rented ones.
You can apply for state-subsidised rental housing if you have one of the following:
Finnish citizenship;
a registered right of residence;
a residence permit card;
a residence permit which is valid for at least 12 months; or
a student’s residence permit.
If you would like to apply for a municipal rental flat, complete the application form at your municipality's housing agency.
Many municipalities also offer online forms on their websites.
In some municipalities, rental flats are so sought-after that you will be forced to wait a very long time for a home.
For example, in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa), housing queues are long. Meanwhile, many smaller municipalities in various parts of Finland have vacant apartments.
The following factors are taken into account when choosing tenants:
income
assets
housing requirement
Many non-profit organisations offer affordable rental housing in Finland.

The following appendices may be required:
your latest payslip
a copy of your taxation decision, indicating your assets
loan certificates
a copy of your residence permit or passport if you are not a citizen of the EU

You have the right to live in a right-of-occupancy dwelling when you first pay a right-of-occupancy payment (asumisoikeusasunto) for it.
The payment is approximately 15 per cent of the price of the dwelling.
If you cannot afford the right-of-occupancy payment yourself, you can obtain a loan from a bank.
You can deduct the loan interest from your taxation.
After that, you will pay a certain amount each month as a charge for use (käyttövastike).
The charge for use varies according to the dwelling and its location.
Under law, the charge for use may not exceed the level of rent paid for similar dwellings in the same area.
If you have a low income, you can apply for housing allowance in order to pay the charge for use.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Housing allowance.
You cannot buy a right-of-occupancy dwelling for yourself.
Why choose a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
A right-of-occupancy dwelling does not involve financial risks.
It is therefore a safer option than owner-occupied housing.
You do not need a large loan for a right-of-occupancy dwelling.
When you want to move out, you do not have to sell the dwelling.
You can live in a right-of-occupancy dwelling for as long as you want.
The house owner cannot terminate the right-of-occupancy contract.
This means that a right-of-occupancy dwelling is more permanent than a rental one.
You can also pass on your right of occupancy through inheritance.
Responsibilities of residents
If you have a right-of-occupancy dwelling, you must use it as your own permanent dwelling.
You can only rent it out to another person for two years at the most.
However, you need the permission of the house owner to do so.
Who can get a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
If the right-of-occupancy dwelling has not been constructed with a state subsidy, the house owner can choose the residents him/herself.
If the dwelling has been constructed with a state subsidy, you can apply to stay there if
you are 18 years of age or older
you do not own a dwelling in the same area
you do not have the funds to buy a dwelling in the same area.
However, your wealth is not taken into account if you are over 55 years of age or you are moving from one right-of-occupancy dwelling into another.
Sometimes, there can also be other conditions.
How to apply for a right-of-occupancy dwelling?
Right-of-occupancy dwellings are available in the biggest Finnish municipalities.
If you want a right-of-occupancy dwelling, you need to get a queue number from the housing office of the municipality.
You can get queue numbers from several municipalities.
Getting a queue number will not cost you anything.
You are not obliged to apply for a dwelling even if you have a queue number.
Next, you need to choose the house from which you want a right-of-occupancy dwelling.
Then report to the house owner.
Let him/her also know what kind of dwelling you are looking for.
You can apply for right-of-occupancy dwellings from several house owners.
You may have to wait a long time for the dwelling to become vacant.
Right-of-occupancy contract
When you get a dwelling, you must sign a written right-of-occupancy contract (asumisoikeussopimus) with the house owner.
The right-of-occupancy contract will state the amount of the right-of-occupancy payment, the charge for use and other possible terms.
You can move in once you have signed the right-of-occupancy contract and paid the right-of-occupancy payment.
Moving out
If you want to give up your dwelling, you need to deliver a corresponding notification (luopumisilmoitus) to the house owner.
Once you have given up the dwelling, the right-of-occupancy payment will be refunded to you.

If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship, you will need an official certificate of your skills in Finnish or Swedish.
You may also need the certificate when applying for a job or study place.
You can prove your language skills with the following:
National Certificate of Language Proficiency (yleinen kielitutkinto)
the Finnish or Swedish grade in your school certificate (päättötodistus)
The National Certificate of Language Proficiency
The National Certificate of Language Proficiency test is intended for adults.
With it you can prove your proficiency in Finnish or Swedish.
The certificate is subject to a charge.
After the test, you will receive a certificate stating the level of your language proficiency.
The language certificate has three levels: basic, intermediate and advanced.
Each level of the certificate covers two proficiency levels, of which there are six altogether.
The basic level is for those who are able to use the language in question in everyday situations, i.e. whose proficiency level is
1–2.
The intermediate level is for those who can speak the language quite well, i.e. whose proficiency level is 3–4.
The advanced level is for those who speak the language extremely well, i.e. whose proficiency level is 5–6.
More detailed descriptions of the proficiency levels are provided on the website of the Finnish National Agency for Education.
If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship (kansalaisuus), you will need to prove that you have a satisfactory level of Finnish or Swedish, which means passing the written and oral part of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency at the minimum level of 3.
The language test takes 3-6 hours.
The subject matters in the assignments are linked to everyday life, such as leisure time, training and the most common work situations.
The test consists of different kinds of questions which require the following skills:
reading comprehension
grammar and vocabulary
listening comprehension
speaking
The test can be taken in different parts of Finland.
You can find out more about enrolment on the website of the Finnish National Agency for Education (Opetushallitus).
The tests are classified according to a different scale than the courses.
If you have completed a language course that has been classified according to the Common European Framework of Reference, the course content corresponds to the level of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency roughly in the following way:
A1 - National Certificate 1
A2 - National Certificate 2
B1 - National Certificate 3
B2 - National Certificate 4
C1 - National Certificate 5
C2 - National Certificate 6
Before you enrol for a test, please read about the requirements for the different levels carefully.

Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate for Finnish and Swedish
If you want to work in public administration, you will usually need a certificate of your skills in Finnish or Swedish.
You can prove your ability in one of these languages with a Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate.
Ask your employer what the language proficiency requirements are for the job you want to apply for.
The test has three levels: satisfactory, good and excellent.
The test level that you need to pass depends on the job or study place in question.
To be granted Finnish citizenship, you will require a certificate of at least satisfactory skills.
Satisfactory or good level tests can be taken in different parts of Finland.
The website of the Finnish National Agency for Education has a list of the towns where the test can be taken.
The test demonstrating excellent skills can only be taken in Helsinki.
The test is composed of various kinds of questions which involve reading and listening to texts and answering questions.
It also includes interview, discussion and writing assignments.
The Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate can be substituted with specific completed studies.
For example, a B.A. / M.A. maturity exam (kypsyysnäyte) taken at a university in Finnish or Swedish corresponds to the Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate’s ‘good’ level.

Owner-occupied dwelling is often cheaper than rental dwelling in the long-term.
Most Finns live in dwellings they own.
There are other alternatives, in addition to owner-occupied dwelling and rental dwelling.
Read more on the InfoFinland pages Right-of-occupancy home and Shared-ownership home.
Housing share and real estate
When you buy a dwelling, you either purchase a housing share (asunto-osake) or real estate (kiinteistö).
Housing shares are dwellings in either blocks of flats or terraced houses.
These houses are owned by housing companies.
When you buy a detached house, you buy real estate.
Real estate usually comprises a detached house and the related plot.
Where to find owner-occupied housing?
When looking for a dwelling, you should prepare for up to several months of searching.
Dwellings are sold by private persons, real estate agencies and housing constructors.
Adverts for available dwellings can be found online and in newspapers, for example.
Once you find a dwelling that interests you, book a time with the seller to go and see it.
Sometimes the adverts indicate a time when you can go and see the dwelling.
In such cases, you do not need to book a time in advance.
linkkiEtuovi.com:

linkkiFinnish Competition and Consumer Authority:
Information on buying a homeFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Find out about the condition of the dwelling and other matters
Once you have found a dwelling that you like, gather all of the relevant information on it.
In particular, you should find out about the condition of the dwelling.
If you are about to buy a housing share, find out if any renovations are planned in the housing company, and if yes, what the related costs will be.
For example, a plumbing renovation can cost the owner-occupier tens of thousands of euros.
Responsibilities of seller and buyer in dwelling sales
The seller of a dwelling is held responsible for any defects in the dwelling for some time after the sale.
The seller’s responsibility for defects usually lasts for two years in the case of housing shares.
In the case of real estate, the seller’s responsibility lasts for five years.
By law, the seller of a dwelling must notify the buyer of any known defects in the dwelling before the sale.
If it is clear that the seller has known about a defect in the dwelling, but has failed to inform the buyer of it, the seller may be obliged to pay compensation to the buyer.
Before you buy a dwelling, inspect it for any defects.
You cannot demand compensation for a defect afterwards if
you should have noticed the defect when inspecting the dwelling; or
you were aware of the defect before buying the dwelling.
The dwelling may also have hidden defects.
This refers to damage of which no one is aware.
Hidden defects often include water damage, for example.
If the dwelling has a serious defect which, if known, would have affected the sale of the dwelling, the seller is obliged to pay compensation to the buyer.
Mortgage
Most people finance their dwelling purchases with a mortgage (asuntolaina).
Anyone can apply for a mortgage from a bank.
In order to be granted a mortgage, your income needs to be at a level that allows you to repay the loan without problems.
Many banks have mortgage calculators on their website.
These allow you to make advance assessments of whether or not you would be able to repay the mortgage.
If you are unsure about whether a bank will grant you a mortgage, it is advisable to visit a bank and negotiate the loan well before buying a dwelling.
Mortgages are repaid, i.e., instalments are paid off, once a month.
In addition, you must pay the bank interest (korko) on the loan.
You can ask for offers from several banks and compare them.
Different mortgages have different conditions.
When you consider different mortgage alternatives, take account of the following:
What is the interest rate on the mortgage?
What is the amount that you must pay back every month?
How many years will it take to pay off your mortgage?
Bear in mind that if interest rates rise, the cost of your mortgage will also increase.
In that event, the monthly payment to the bank will increase or the loan period will extend.
You can have some of the mortgage interest deducted against tax.
linkkiFinnish Competition and Consumer Authority:
Information on mortgageFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Mortgage collaterals and securities
A mortgage usually requires collateral (vakuus).
The dwelling that you will buy usually covers about 70 per cent of the mortgage.
In addition to that, you need collateral for the remaining amount of the mortgage.
You can arrange collateral by, for example,
The state guarantee covers up to 20 per cent of the mortgage and not more than 50,000 euros in total.
Asking one of your relatives or friends to secure the loan.
If you are unable to repay the mortgage to the bank, the guarantor will have to pay the amount of mortgage he/she has secured.
However, you will not need guarantors for your loan if you have saved up part of the price of the dwelling in advance, or if you have property that can be accepted as collateral for the mortgage.
linkkiMinistry of the Environment:
Information on state guarantees for mortgagesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Support for buying a dwelling
The state grants interest subsidy (korkotuki) on mortgages.
Interest subsidy is granted to young people buying their first dwelling.
It is also granted to those buying or building a detached house.
Read more on the Ministry of the Environment's website.
linkkiMinistry of the Environment:
Information on interest subsidyFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Transfer tax
When buying a dwelling, you also need to pay transfer tax (varainsiirtovero).
If you buy a housing share, the transfer tax is 2 per cent of the debt-free price of the dwelling.
If you buy real estate, the transfer tax is 4 per cent of the debt-free price of the dwelling.
However, you will not need to pay transfer tax if all of the following conditions are met:
you are 18–39 years old
you have not previously owned a dwelling in Finland or another country
you own at least 50 per cent of the dwelling
you use the dwelling as your own permanent home.
linkkiTax Administration:
First-time homebuyers’ exemption from transfer taxFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Bidding
When you are sure that you want and can buy a dwelling, you can make a bid for it.
It is advisable to make the bid in writing.
The bidding price can be, for example, 5–10 per cent less than the seller is asking for the dwelling.
However, the seller may not always be willing to lower the price that he/she has asked for.
A bid is binding.
This means that you cannot cancel your bid.
If you cancel a bid, you may need to pay a fine or the down payment to the seller.
The amount usually equals a few per cent of the price of the dwelling.
Information on prices of dwellings soldFinnish _ Swedish
Buying a dwelling
If the seller of the dwelling accepts the bid, the agreement is signed in the buyer’s bank.
Those present usually include the buyer, the seller and the real estate agent if one was used.
A sales contract is an agreement specifying, for example, the size, price and condition of the dwelling as well as the day on which the buyer gains possession of the dwelling.
The sales contract is usually prepared by the bank or the real estate agent.
The buyer has the right to familiarise him/herself with the contents of the sales contract before the signing date.
The bank grants a mortgage to the buyer and the mortgage amount is transferred to the seller's bank account.
Down payment
A down payment (käsiraha) is an advance payment on the dwelling.
The buyer can pay a down payment to the seller at the sale preparation stage.
A down payment is usually around three per cent of the price of the dwelling.
If your own savings are insufficient for making the down payment, you can borrow it from the bank as part of your mortgage.
Costs of owner-occupied dwelling
Your cost of living depends on the following:
the amount of your mortgage
the size of your dwelling
the condition of your dwelling
the location of your dwelling.
Housing share
If you own a housing share, you usually pay
repayments and interest on your mortgage
charge for financial costs (rahoitusvastike) if the housing company holds debt
water rates and electricity charges
possible repairs.
Real estate
If you own real estate, you usually pay
repayments and interest on your mortgage
real estate tax (kiinteistövero)
water rates and electricity charges
heating costs
waste collection fees
possible repairs.
Domestic waste
In Finland, domestic waster has to be sorted into different waste bins.

There are two kinds of tenancy agreements:
tenancy agreements that are valid until further notice
fixed-term tenancy agreements.
A tenancy agreement that is valid until further notice (toistaiseksi voimassa oleva vuokrasopimus) will only end once either the tenant or the landlord terminates it.
If you do not know in advance how long you will stay in the dwelling, this kind of agreement is a good alternative.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement (määräaikainen vuokrasopimus) means that the tenant and the landlord agree upon conclusion of the tenancy agreement when the agreement will end.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement will automatically end on the date specified in the agreement without separate notice.
If you wish to continue staying in the dwelling after this, you need to make a new tenancy agreement.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement cannot be terminated during its validity period.
This applies to both the tenant and the landlord.
If you know in advance that you will only need the dwelling for a specific period of time, a fixed-term tenancy agreement is a good alternative.
Payment of rent
Rents are usually paid once a month.
The rent must be paid by the latest on the due date.
The due date is specified in the tenancy agreement.
Pay the rent as a bank transfer to the landlord’s bank account.
You cannot pay rent with a credit card.
Rent security deposit
In Finland, almost all tenancy agreements require that you pay a rent security deposit.
This means that you pay the landlord in advance a sum of money that equals a few months rent.
The rent security deposit usually equals two months' rent.
The deposit can be worth three months' rent at the most.
Pay the rent security deposit to the landlord by the date agreed in the tenancy agreement.
Usually, you get keys to the dwelling once you have paid the rent security deposit.
Once the tenancy agreement ends, a final inspection is made in the dwelling.
The landlord will return the whole rent security deposit to you if
you have kept the dwelling in good condition and
you have made all the payments agreed with the landlord.
If, however, you have broken something in the dwelling or failed to pay enough rent, the landlord will not return the whole rent security deposit.
The rent security deposit cannot be used to pay the last months rents.
Other payments
In addition to rent, you should reserve money for other expenses, too.
Water
The tenant is usually required to pay a water rate.
Pay the water rate in connection with the rent, either to the landlord or the housing company.
The water rate is often determined according to the number of residents in the dwelling.
If the dwelling has a water meter, the amount of water rate depends on how much water you use.
Electricity
You will usually need to sign an electricity contract with an electricity provider yourself.
You can obtain an electricity contract by calling an electricity company and supplying them with your name and new address.
You can compare the prices offered by different electricity companies if you wish to find the cheapest one.
Heating
If the dwelling has central heating, it is usually included in the rent.
If the dwelling has oil or electric heating, it sometimes needs to be paid separately.
Sauna, laundry room and parking space
If you wish to use the housing company's sauna, laundry room or parking space, this is usually subject to a fee.
These fees are usually paid directly to the housing company.
Payments in a detached house
If you are a tenant in a detached house, you often have to pay for the heating and waste management, too.
Termination of tenancy agreement
The notice period refers to the period of time in which the agreement remains in force after a notice of termination has been given.
The notice period applies to a tenancy agreement that is valid until further notice.
For a tenant, the notice period is always one calendar month.
Remember to consider how the notice period is calculated.
Usually, the notice period does not begin until the end of the month during which the notice has been given.
For example, if you want to move out on 1 December, it is advisable to give notice on 31 October at the latest.
Otherwise, you will also need to pay rent for December.
Always make the notice of termination in writing.
You must be able to prove that you have given the notice to the landlord.
For a landlord, the length of the notice period depends on how long the tenancy agreement has been in force.
If the tenancy agreement has been in effect for less than a year, the notice period is three months.
If the tenancy agreement has been in effect for more than a year, the notice period is six months.
A fixed-term tenancy agreement cannot be terminated during its validity period.
Sub-leasing
Sub-leasing means that a tenant rents out part of the dwelling to another person.
The tenant has the right to do so if this does not cause significant harm to the dwelling’s actual landlord.
When planning sub-tenancy, make sure that the primary tenant has the right to take sub-tenants.
You are also considered a sub-tenant in case you have only rented part of a dwelling and the owner him/herself lives in the same dwelling.
A sub-tenant's notice period is shorter than that of the primary tenant.
Secondary leasing
Secondary leasing means that a tenant leases an entire dwelling to another person.
This always requires permission from the landlord.
A secondary tenant has the same termination procedure as the primary tenant.

Finland is a bilingual country
Finland has two official languages, Finnish and Swedish.
Both these languages have a long history in Finland.
Approximately 90 per cent of Finns speak Finnish as their first language and roughly 5 per cent speak Swedish.
You can use either language when dealing with government officials, for example, at the Employment and Economic Development Office (työ- ja elinkeinotoimisto).
Swedish is spoken the most on Finland’s western and southern coast.
In a few localities, Swedish is spoken more commonly than Finnish.
Find out which is the most common language in your locality.
Municipalities can be monolingual or bilingual.
If the municipality is bilingual, you can use either Finnish or Swedish when dealing with municipal employees, for example, at the Social Welfare Office (sosiaalitoimisto).
Some jobs require both Finnish and Swedish skills.
In Finnish schools, both Finnish and Swedish are studied.
Pupils whose first language is Finnish study Swedish at school.
Pupils whose first language is Swedish study Finnish.
If an immigrant child goes to a school where the teaching language is Finnish, they will also study Swedish as a foreign language together with the Finnish children.
What kind of a language is Finnish?
Finnish is a Finno-Ugric language.
Its kindred languages include, for example, Estonian and Hungarian.
Finnish has a high number of inflected forms, for example, the cases of nouns, adjectives, numerals and pronouns, as well as the persons and tenses of verbs.
There are fewer prepositions than in Indo-European languages, for example.
Finnish also has some postpositions.
Word order is freer than in many other languages.
Finnish also has many loanwords, for example, from Swedish, German, Russian and English.
Finnish pronunciation is very regular.
Words are always stressed on the first syllable.
In Finland, it is common to be on first-name terms with other people.
Sometimes it may be polite to address someone more formally.
For example, customers or elderly persons are often addressed with the Finnish plural form of you, ‘te’.
What kind of a language is Swedish?
Swedish is an Indo-European language and belongs in the group of North Germanic languages.
Its kindred languages include, for example, Norwegian, Danish and German.
Swedish also has a great number of loanwords, for example, from French.
In Swedish, verbs inflect for different tenses.
Nouns are divided into two genders.
Adjectives inflect by these genders.
Swedish uses a large number of prepositions and its word order is very regular.
The Swedish spoken in Finland is called Finland Swedish.
It is pronounced somewhat differently from the Swedish spoken in Sweden.
Swedish pronunciation in both countries is fairly regular.
Domestic minority languages
In addition to Finnish and Swedish, Finland has also some other domestic languages.
Sami languages are the indigenous languages of Finland.
Three Sami languages are spoken here.
They belong in the group of Finno-Ugric languages.
The Romani language spoken in Finland is an Indo-European language.
Finland also has its own sign language.
You can find out more about these languages on the website of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland.

In Finland, there are different ways to describe the level of a language course.
Often the rating scale of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEF) (eurooppalainen viitekehys, EVK) is used.
This scale contains the following levels:
levels A1 and A2: basic language skills (peruskielitaito)
levels B1 and B2: language skills of an independent user (itsenäisen kielenkäyttäjän kielitaito)
levels C1 and C2: language skills of a proficient user (taitavan kielenkäyttäjän kielitaito)
These levels are further divided into sublevels.
For example, level A1 comprises courses A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3, and level A2 courses A2.1 and A2.2.
The Finnish National Agency for Education’s (Opetushallitus) website offers more information about what the different levels mean in practice.
You can also ask directly at an educational establishment.
The InfoFinland web page Official certificate of language proficiency provides information about how to compare course levels to the level of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency test (yleinen kielitutkinto).

In Finland, many people live in rental housing.
The upside of renting is that switching flats is easy, as you do not have to sell your old home and buy a new one.
On the other hand, your landlord may decide to terminate your lease if he or she has an acceptable reason for doing so.
In such an eventuality, you will be forced to move out of your flat even if you would not wish to.
There is important information on the InfoFinland page Tenancy agreement about giving notice, paying rent, the deposit and other costs in a rental dwelling.
It is often difficult to find a suitable flat for rent in the largest cities, where the rents are also higher.
Reserve enough time for finding a flat.
Some areas are extremely popular and any vacant flats are rented very quickly.
When you have found a suitable place, you should quickly decide whether to rent it or not.
According to Finnish law, a landlord choosing a tenant must not discriminate against anyone on the basis of factors such as ethnic origin, religion or nationality.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Discrimination and racism.
How can I get a rental flat?
You can look for advertisements online.
Use ”vuokra-asunto” as the search term.
Flats are also often advertised in local newspapers.
Search for rental dwellingsFinnish _ English
Search for rental dwellingsFinnish
Private rental housing
You can usually find a privately rented flat quicker than a municipal one, but the rent will generally be higher.
You do not need to use an agent to look for a flat.
You can look for information on vacant flats yourself.
In that case you do not need to pay a commission (välityspalkkio).
You can look for private rental flats online and in local newspapers.
You can also publish your own wanted ad.
If you wish to rent a private flat, contact the landlord to agree on a date to inspect the flat.
Showings are usually arranged for all interested parties simultaneously.
At the showing, you will be given an application form.
Complete the form if you are interested in renting the flat.
If you wish to have an agent look for a suitable rental flat, you must make an assignment agreement (toimeksiantosopimus) in writing with the agent.
In this case you will have to pay a commission to the agent.
Agree on the commission in writing in advance.
The commission could be, for example, a month’s rent.
Compare the commissions of various agencies in advance.
If you rent a private flat, sign a lease with the landlord.
More information is available on the InfoFinland page Rental agreements.
Prices of privately-financed rental housingEnglish
Municipal rental housing
Many municipalities own rental flats, and these are often more affordable than privately rented ones.
You can apply for state-subsidised rental housing if you have one of the following:
Finnish citizenship;
a registered right of residence;
a residence permit card;
a residence permit which is valid for at least 12 months; or
a student’s residence permit.
If you would like to apply for a municipal rental flat, complete the application form at your municipality's housing agency.
Many municipalities also offer online forms on their websites.
In some municipalities, rental flats are so sought-after that you will be forced to wait a very long time for a home.
For example, in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa), housing queues are long. Meanwhile, many smaller municipalities in various parts of Finland have vacant apartments.
The following factors are taken into account when choosing tenants:
income
assets
housing requirement
Many non-profit organisations offer affordable rental housing in Finland.
Prices of state-subsidised rental housingEnglish
Student housing
Students can apply for student housing, which is normally cheaper than other alternatives.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Student housing.
The housing application and its appendices
When you file a housing application, you may be required to enclose other documents with it, depending on the party offering the flat.
The following appendices may be required:
your latest payslip
a copy of your taxation decision, indicating your assets
loan certificates
a copy of your residence permit or passport if you are not a citizen of the EU
Applicants are also frequently subjected to a credit check.

If you apply for Finnish citizenship, you need a certificate of sufficient proficiency in the Finnish or Swedish language.
For more information, see the InfoFinland page Official certificate of language proficiency.
You can use Swedish with government authorities, such as Kela or the TE Office.
When you register as a resident, inform the local register office of the language in which you want to use services.
You can also change the language later.
Municipalities in Finland can be either monolingual or bilingual.
Most of the municipalities in Finland are Finnish-speaking.
There are bilingual municipalities on the southern and western coasts.
If your municipality of residence is bilingual, you can also use Swedish with municipal services, such as the health centre.

Swedish-language integration may be a good choice for you, if:
You live in an area with many Swedish speakers.
You have family members or relatives who speak Swedish.
You already speak some Swedish.
Swedish language skills could be useful when you look for work.
However, please note that most jobs require proficiency in Finnish.
Even if you choose Swedish-language integration training, you should also study Finnish at some point.
In some municipalities, you can participate in Swedish-language integration training.
If you cannot get into Swedish-language integration training, in some cases you can still get support for independent Swedish studies if it is agreed on in your integration or employment plan.
Ask about Swedish-language integration when your preliminary assessment and integration plan is being prepared.
According to law, you have the right to choose Finnish or Swedish as your integration language.

If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship, you will need an official certificate of your skills in Finnish or Swedish.
You may also need the certificate when applying for a job or study place.
You can prove your language skills with the following:
National Certificate of Language Proficiency (yleinen kielitutkinto)
the Finnish or Swedish grade in your school certificate (päättötodistus)
The National Certificate of Language Proficiency
The National Certificate of Language Proficiency test is intended for adults.
With it you can prove your proficiency in Finnish or Swedish.
The certificate is subject to a charge.
After the test, you will receive a certificate stating the level of your language proficiency.
The language certificate has three levels: basic, intermediate and advanced.
Each level of the certificate covers two proficiency levels, of which there are six altogether.
The basic level is for those who are able to use the language in question in everyday situations, i.e. whose proficiency level is
1–2.
The intermediate level is for those who can speak the language quite well, i.e. whose proficiency level is 3–4.
The advanced level is for those who speak the language extremely well, i.e. whose proficiency level is 5–6.
More detailed descriptions of the proficiency levels are provided on the website of the Finnish National Board of Education.
If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship (kansalaisuus), you will need to prove that you have a satisfactory level of Finnish or Swedish, which means passing the written and oral part of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency at the minimum level of 3.
The language test takes 3-6 hours.
The subject matters in the assignments are linked to everyday life, such as leisure time, training and the most common work situations.
The test consists of different kinds of questions which require the following skills:
reading comprehension
grammar and vocabulary
listening comprehension
speaking
The test can be taken in different parts of Finland.
You can find out more about enrolment on the website of the Finnish National Board of Education (Opetushallitus).
The tests are classified according to a different scale than the courses.
If you have completed a language course that has been classified according to the Common European Framework of Reference, the course content corresponds to the level of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency roughly in the following way:
A1 - National Certificate 1
A2 - National Certificate 2
B1 - National Certificate 3
B2 - National Certificate 4
C1 - National Certificate 5
C2 - National Certificate 6
Before you enrol for a test, please read about the requirements for the different levels carefully.
You can also ask your Finnish or Swedish teacher for advice.

Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate for Finnish and Swedish
If you want to work in public administration, you will usually need a certificate of your skills in Finnish or Swedish.
You can prove your ability in one of these languages with a Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate.
Ask your employer what the language proficiency requirements are for the job you want to apply for.
The test has three levels: satisfactory, good and excellent.
The test level that you need to pass depends on the job or study place in question.
To be granted Finnish citizenship, you will require a certificate of at least satisfactory skills.
Satisfactory or good level tests can be taken in different parts of Finland.
The website of the Finnish National Board of Education has a list of the towns where the test can be taken.
The test demonstrating excellent skills can only be taken in Helsinki.
The test is composed of various kinds of questions which involve reading and listening to texts and answering questions.
It also includes interview, discussion and writing assignments.
The Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate can be substituted with specific completed studies.
For example, a B.A. / M.A. maturity exam (kypsyysnäyte) taken at a university in Finnish or Swedish corresponds to the Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate’s ‘good’ level.
For more information, go to the website of the Finnish National Board of Education.

Internal communication at the workplace
Usually information about forthcoming events and changes at a workplace is given at meetings.
Attending meetings gives you a chance to influence matters, suggest changes and develop your work.
Every workplace also has other appointed channels of internal communication, such as notice boards, e-mail or mail boxes assigned for employees.
Follow the communications at your workplace.
Breaks
Often a contract of employment gives information about when breaks occur during a working day and how long they are.
Often there is a short coffee break in the morning, a lunch break in the middle of the day and another coffee break in the afternoon.
The length of a lunch break varies according to workplace.
It is a good idea to check the length of the breaks with your supervisor.
Eating during breaks is arranged in different ways at different workplaces: some have their own canteen, while at others employees bring their own food from home.
At some workplaces, employees can buy affordable lunch vouchers that can be used at restaurants close to the workplace.
People do not usually work during lunch.
Taking care of personal business during a working day
It is not permitted to take care of personal affairs during working hours; instead, they have to be dealt with outside working hours.
The number of working hours agreed upon in the contract of employment is binding and the agreed-upon hours have to be performed.
During a break, you can make, for example, important personal calls.
You can also apply for unpaid time off, if the situation requires a longer absence from work.
If for some reason you cannot, for example, get a doctor’s appointment outside working hours, negotiate with your supervisor about your absence and make an agreement about a way to compensate for the time you will be at the doctor’s.
You can visit occupational health care during working hours.
Work-related training
Even if an employee already has the required training for the occupation when they start work, many employers encourage their employees to acquire additional training.
Often it is possible to attend training programmes during working hours, and an employer may pay for the training.
Most employers appreciate their employee’s desire to advance in their occupation and to learn new skills.
Usually presents are not given at the workplace.
However, on special days (birthdays, marriage, retirement) workmates and the employer usually give a small present or bouquet of flowers to the person whose special day it is.
Working hours and holidays
A normal working day usually lasts eight hours.
An employee can also agree with their employer on different working hours.
In Finland, employees usually do not work a lot of overtime.
People work the hours agreed on in their employment contract.
In Finland, the holiday season begins at the beginning of May.
The number of holidays an employee is entitled to depends on the number of years the employee has worked and when the contract of employment has started.
In addition to paid holidays, you can apply for unpaid leave.
In Finland, holidays are long compared to many other countries.
Well-being at work and work-related recreation
Many workplaces want to support their employees’ well-being and happiness at work by arranging different kinds of recreational days and workplace celebrations.An employer may also offer employees various opportunities for leisure activities.
Annual holidays
Some days are public holidays in Finland.
Such holidays include:
New Year, 1 January
Twelfth Day, 6 January
Easter: the date varies, in March or April
May Day, 1 May
Midsummer Eve: in June, always on a Friday
Independence Day, 6 December
Christmas Day, 25 December
Boxing Day, 26 December
Read more about these days on the InfoFinland page Finnish holidays.
At some work places, hospitals for example, these public holidays are also working days.
Employees are paid a higher salary for the holidays during which they work.
Check from your collective agreement what the compensation for working during the holidays is.
Finland is a bilingual country
Finland has two official languages, Finnish and Swedish.
Both these languages have a long history in Finland.
Approximately 90 per cent of Finns speak Finnish as their first language and roughly 5 per cent speak Swedish.
You can use either language when dealing with government officials, for example, at the Employment and Economic Development Office (työ- ja elinkeinotoimisto).
Swedish is spoken the most on Finland’s western and southern coast.
In a few localities, Swedish is spoken more commonly than Finnish.
Find out which is the most common language in your locality.
Municipalities can be monolingual or bilingual.
If the municipality is bilingual, you can use either Finnish or Swedish when dealing with municipal employees, for example, at the Social Welfare Office (sosiaalitoimisto).
Some jobs require both Finnish and Swedish skills.
In Finnish schools, both Finnish and Swedish are studied.
Pupils whose first language is Finnish study Swedish at school.
Pupils whose first language is Swedish study Finnish.
If an immigrant child goes to a school where the teaching language is Finnish, they will also study Swedish as a foreign language together with the Finnish children.
What kind of a language is Finnish?
Finnish is a Finno-Ugric language.
Its kindred languages include, for example, Estonian and Hungarian.
Finnish has a high number of inflected forms, for example, the cases of nouns, adjectives, numerals and pronouns, as well as the persons and tenses of verbs.
There are fewer prepositions than in Indo-European languages, for example.
Finnish also has some postpositions.
Word order is freer than in many other languages.
Finnish also has many loanwords, for example, from Swedish, German, Russian and English.
Finnish pronunciation is very regular.
Words are always stressed on the first syllable.
In Finland, it is common to be on first-name terms with other people.
Sometimes it may be polite to address someone more formally.
For example, customers or elderly persons are often addressed with the Finnish plural form of you, ‘te’.
What kind of a language is Swedish?
Swedish is an Indo-European language and belongs in the group of North Germanic languages.
Its kindred languages include, for example, Norwegian, Danish and German.
Swedish also has a great number of loanwords, for example, from French.
In Swedish, verbs inflect for different tenses.
Nouns are divided into two genders.
Adjectives inflect by these genders.
Swedish uses a large number of prepositions and its word order is very regular.
The Swedish spoken in Finland is called Finland Swedish.
It is pronounced somewhat differently from the Swedish spoken in Sweden.
Swedish pronunciation in both countries is fairly regular.
Domestic minority languages
In addition to Finnish and Swedish, Finland has also some other domestic languages.
Sami languages are the indigenous languages of Finland.
Three Sami languages are spoken here.
They belong in the group of Finno-Ugric languages.
The Romani language spoken in Finland is an Indo-European language.
Finland also has its own sign language.
You can find out more about these languages on the website of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland.

In Finland, there are different ways to describe the level of a language course.
Often the rating scale of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEF) (eurooppalainen viitekehys, EVK) is used.
This scale contains the following levels:
levels A1 and A2: basic language skills (peruskielitaito)
levels B1 and B2: language skills of an independent user (itsenäisen kielenkäyttäjän kielitaito)
levels C1 and C2: language skills of a proficient user (taitavan kielenkäyttäjän kielitaito)
These levels are further divided into sublevels.
For example, level A1 comprises courses A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3, and level A2 courses A2.1 and A2.2.
The Finnish National Board of Education’s (Opetushallitus) website offers more information about what the different levels mean in practice.
You can also ask directly at an educational establishment.
The InfoFinland web page Official certificate of language proficiency provides information about how to compare course levels to the level of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency test (yleinen kielitutkinto).

Honesty, punctuality and equality are appreciated in Finland.
This shows in all Finnish culture, including working life.
This page describes Finnish working culture.
Laws and agreements on working life
Finnish working life has many rules that the employee and employer must follow.
The legislation and collective agreements determine, for example, minimum wages, working hours, holidays, sick pay and the terms of dismissal.
Sometimes, the employer may ask the employee to work overtime.
According to law, the employer must pay supplemented wages for overtime.
You can also get compensated as time off work.
You have the right to refuse to work overtime.
More information on the rights and obligations of employees in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Employee’s rights and obligations.

Learn Finnish or Swedish
You can improve your language skills in courses or on the job.
Do not hesitate to speak Finnish or Swedish with your co-workers.
Read more about studying languages on the InfoFinland page Finnish and Swedish.
Equality and equal opportunities in working life
According to Finnish law, all kinds of discrimination at workplaces is prohibited.
Employers must ensure that there is equality and equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Equality and equal opportunities in working life.
Initiative and responsibility
At Finnish workplaces, supervisors do not monitor their employees’ work continually.
Employers ask for their employees’ opinions and these are taken into account in job planning.
Work is usually arranged and agreed on at common meetings and jointly agreed matters are adhered to.
A supervisor gives an employee their tasks and expects the employee to decide on the details of the work independently.
If an employee does not know how to perform the given task or cannot do it, they ask their co-workers or the supervisor directly for instructions.
Reliability and observing timetables
In Finnish working culture, it is important to adhere to the things that have been agreed upon.
When something has been decided together, the employees and employer assume that everyone will do what has been decided.
Observing timetables is also important in Finland.
You must arrive at work promptly at the agreed-upon time.
When the agreement is 8:00, this means exactly 8:00, not 8:10.
Being late is impolite because other people have to wait for the one who is late.
If you know that you will be late for work, tell your supervisor about it.
Many workplaces have adopted flexible working hours which means that you can come to work, for example, between 7 and 9 and leave between 15 and 17.
If a workplace uses flexible working hours, employees themselves have to make sure that they work for the length of time that has been agreed upon.
Style of communication
Finns usually speak out, and speaking out is not considered impolite in Finland.
Saying what you mean is also normal in working life.
For example, if you do not have enough time to complete a task, it is best to say so to your supervisor.
At meetings, the usual procedure is to get straight to the point after greeting everybody.
In Finnish working culture, the form of address is very informal.
At most workplaces, all employees address each other using first names regardless of their position.
The effect of religion on working life
Many Finns are Christians but not very religious.
However, many Christian customs are still observed in Finnish culture.
In working life, the effect of religion can be seen in many of the holidays.
Christian religious holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are statutory holidays.
Read more on InfoFinland page Finnish holidays.
Religious customs or rituals do not belong at a Finnish workplace.
Some places of work have arranged a place for praying, if employees have asked for one.
However, most workplaces do not provide for such practices.
If an employee wants to take a moment, for example, for prayer in the middle of a working day, this must take place in connection with the agreed-upon breaks.
Signs of religions in outward appearance, such as head scarves, are permitted in Finland, but operative rules on working clothes have to be observed.
This is due to task-related work safety and hygiene decrees.
You can read more about the values and customers of Finnish society on the page Finnish customs.
Bilingual municipalities in Finland
Finland has two official languages, Finnish and Swedish.
Approximately 90% of Finns speak Finnish as their native language.
Approximately 5% of Finns speak Swedish as their native language.
Swedish is spoken the most on Finland’s western and southern coast.

If you apply for Finnish citizenship, you need a certificate of sufficient proficiency in the Finnish or Swedish language.
For more information, see the InfoFinland page Official certificate of language proficiency.
You can use Swedish with government authorities, such as Kela or the TE Office.
When you register as a resident, inform the local register office of the language in which you want to use services.
You can also change the language later.
Municipalities in Finland can be either monolingual or bilingual.
Most of the municipalities in Finland are Finnish-speaking.
There are bilingual municipalities on the southern and western coasts.
If your municipality of residence is bilingual, you can also use Swedish with municipal services, such as the health centre.

Swedish-language integration may be a good choice for you, if:
You live in an area with many Swedish speakers.
You have family members or relatives who speak Swedish.
You already speak some Swedish.
Swedish language skills could be useful when you look for work.
However, please note that most jobs require proficiency in Finnish.
Even if you choose Swedish-language integration training, you should also study Finnish at some point.
In some municipalities, you can participate in Swedish-language integration training.
If you cannot get into Swedish-language integration training, in some cases you can still get support for independent Swedish studies if it is agreed on in your integration or employment plan.
Ask about Swedish-language integration when your preliminary assessment and integration plan is being prepared.
According to law, you have the right to choose Finnish or Swedish as your integration language.

Finland has two pension systems which complement each other:
Earnings-related pension is earned by your paid work and entrepreneurial activities.
It is the responsibility of an employer to take out a retirement pension insurance policy for all their employees and to pay the insurance premiums.
An entrepreneur takes care of their own insurance premiums.
National pensions and guarantee pensions are meant for those pensioners who have no earnings-related pension or whose pension is very small.
Both pension systems include old-age pension and disability pension.
You will be eligible to receive a national pension once you have turned 65.
The age at which you can receive earnings-related pension depends on your year of birth.
Check your pension age in your pension record or with your pension institution.
A person who is incapable of work may receive disability pension before their old-age pension begins.
A pensioner can also work, if he/she so chooses to do.
If you are on old-age pension, your earned income will not have an effect on the amount of pension you receive.
In Finland pensions are taxable income.
Employers and employees finance earnings-related pension cover together.
The employer collects their employees’ contribution from their pay and renders this and their own share of the insurance fee to the pension institution.
The amount of earnings-related pension depends on how long you have worked and how high your salary has been.
Earnings-related pension companies, pension funds and pension foundations manage earning-related pensions.
The Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK) takes care of issues related to pension security in a centralised manner.
linkkiFinnish Centre for Pensions:
Earnings-related pensionFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Check your accumulated pension from your pension record
Your pension institution will send you a pension record at regular intervals.
The record presents an estimate of how much pension you have accumulated.
You can also order a pension record from your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
Keep an eye on the accumulated pension in your pension record to ensure that it has been calculated correctly.
If there is an error in the information, contact your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
Keep any testimonials of service for verification.
Payslips should also be kept.
Ordering a pension recordFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Estonian
You can apply for national pension if you have not accumulated earnings-related pension or if it is very small.The amount of national pension is affected by how long you have lived or worked in Finland.
In addition to this, your family situation and other continuous pension income affect the amount of national pension paid.
Kela handles national pensions and guarantee pensions.
You can apply for national pension and guarantee pension if you are covered by Finnish social security and have resided in Finland for at least 3 years since you turned 16.
The time you have lived in another EU or EEC country may also be partially considered.
Guarantee pension provides pensioners with minimum livelihood.
The amount of guarantee pension you will receive is the difference between the other pensions you might receive and the full guarantee pension.
If the sum total of your other pensions is more that the full guarantee pension, you are not eligible for guarantee pension.
More information on guarantee pension is available at Kela.
In some cases, you can also receive a national pension before turning 65.
More information on early national pension and additional days related to national pension can be obtained from Kela.

You can also apply for old-age pension and guarantee pension by calling Kela.
Kela’s customer service number for pension matters is 020 692 202.
Pension from abroad
If you have resided or worked in other EU countries or in countries with which Finland has a social security agreement, you might be eligible to receive pension from these countries.
You can apply for pension from these countries at the same time as you apply for Finnish earnings-related or national pension.
Attach to your application a separate form Residence and Employment Abroad.
You can print the form at the website of Kela or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
If you have worked in a country with which Finland does not have a social security agreement, you must find out for yourself if you are eligible to receive pension from that country.
If you are entitled to receive pension, you must apply for it yourself.
The Finnish Centre for Pension will give you advice for applying for pension abroad.
Read more on the website of the Finnish Centre for Pension.
You can also ask for advice at Kela.

Paying pension abroad
Earnings-related pension paid abroad
If you leave Finland, you will be paid earnings-related pension accrued in Finland when you reach retirement age.
Earnings-related pension can be paid to any country.
It is important that you have a testimonial of service for each contract of employment you have had in Finland.
Payslips should also be kept
The way in which you should apply for pension to be paid abroad depends on your country of residence.
You can contact your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions for advice.
Before applying for pension, request a pension record from your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
The pension record indicates how much pension you have accumulated in Finland.
Kela pensions paid abroad
Always notify Kela if you move abroad permanently or reside in a foreign country for more than three months.
If your residence abroad is temporary, i.e. less than one year, Kela will usually continue to pay your pension normally.
In some cases Kela may continue to pay for example old-age and family pension to some countries even if you move there for more than a year.
These countries include for example other EU and EEA member states and some of the countries with which Finland has a social security agreement.
Guarantee pension will not be paid if you move abroad for more than a year.
Kela website contains further information on incidences when you can receive Kela pensions abroad.
You can also ask about your situation at a Kela office or telephone service.
Partial early old-age pension
If you have turned 61, you can enter partial retirement before your minimum old-age pension age.
This arrangement is called partial early old-age pension.
You can choose whether to receive 25% of 50% of your monthly earning-related pension amount.
If you wish, you can continue working full-time or agree upon shorter working hours with your employer.
You can also stop working altogether.
Please note that the partial early old-age pension will permanently reduce the ultimate amount of your old-age pension.
Ask your pension institution for more information.
If you are ill for a long time, you will normally receive sickness allowance for about a year.
If you cannot return to work due to an illness or injury, you can apply for disability pension (työkyvyttömyyseläke) or rehabilitation subsidy ( kuntoutustuki).
Rehabilitation subsidy is a fixed-term disability pension.
Apply for disability pension with a form available from Kela. You must attach medical certificate B to your application.
Kela and your authorised pension provider will evaluate whether you are fit for work and whether you would benefit from rehabilitation.
Further information on disability pension and rehabilitation subsidy is available from Kela, your pension institution or from your occupational health care provider.
If you are on disability pension, your earned income will affect the amount of pension you receive.
Notify Kela and your authorised pension provider if you go to work.
If your earned income per month is sufficiently large, you can let your pension lie.
This means that you can take a break from collecting your pension.
The break can be at least three months and at most two years long.
You will not lose your right to receive disability pension during the time that you let your pension lie.
Other benefits for pensioners
In addition to pension, Kela may pay pensioners with low income housing allowance for pensioners.
More information on housing allowance for pensioners is available on the Kela website.
Kela may pay care allowance for pensioners for individuals with long-term illness or disabled people.
Ask for more information at Kela.
Discounts for pensioners
After you have retired, you can receive pensioner discounts, for example, for train, plane and bus fares in Finland.
Persons of 65 years old or over receive a discount on a travel fare by presenting their identity card.
A pensioner under 65 years of age can receive discounts by presenting their identity card and earnings-related pension card or national pension card.
Check the conditions of pensioner discounts from a ticket office.

If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship, you will need an official certificate of your skills in Finnish or Swedish.
You may also need the certificate when applying for a job or study place.
You can prove your language skills with the following:
National Certificate of Language Proficiency (yleinen kielitutkinto)
the Finnish or Swedish grade in your school certificate (päättötodistus)
The National Certificate of Language Proficiency
The National Certificate of Language Proficiency test is intended for adults.
With it you can prove your proficiency in Finnish or Swedish.
The certificate is subject to a charge.
After the test, you will receive a certificate stating the level of your language proficiency.
The language certificate has three levels: basic, intermediate and advanced.
Each level of the certificate covers two proficiency levels, of which there are six altogether.
The basic level is for those who are able to use the language in question in everyday situations, i.e. whose proficiency level is
1–2.
The intermediate level is for those who can speak the language quite well, i.e. whose proficiency level is 3–4.
The advanced level is for those who speak the language extremely well, i.e. whose proficiency level is 5–6.
More detailed descriptions of the proficiency levels are provided on the website of the Finnish National Board of Education.
If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship (kansalaisuus), you will need to prove that you have a satisfactory level of Finnish or Swedish, which means passing the written and oral part of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency at the minimum level of 3.
The language test takes 3-6 hours.
The subject matters in the assignments are linked to everyday life, such as leisure time, training and the most common work situations.
The test consists of different kinds of questions which require the following skills:
reading comprehension
writing
grammar and vocabulary
listening comprehension
speaking
The test can be taken in different parts of Finland.
You can find out more about enrolment on the website of the Finnish National Board of Education (Opetushallitus).
The tests are classified according to a different scale than the courses.
If you have completed a language course that has been classified according to the Common European Framework of Reference, the course content corresponds to the level of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency roughly in the following way:
A1 - National Certificate 1
A2 - National Certificate 2
B1 - National Certificate 3
B2 - National Certificate 4
C1 - National Certificate 5
C2 - National Certificate 6
Before you enrol for a test, please read about the requirements for the different levels carefully.
You can also ask your Finnish or Swedish teacher for advice.

Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate for Finnish and Swedish
If you want to work in public administration, you will usually need a certificate of your skills in Finnish or Swedish.
You can prove your ability in one of these languages with a Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate.
Ask your employer what the language proficiency requirements are for the job you want to apply for.
The test has three levels: satisfactory, good and excellent.
The test level that you need to pass depends on the job or study place in question.
To be granted Finnish citizenship, you will require a certificate of at least satisfactory skills.
Satisfactory or good level tests can be taken in different parts of Finland.
The website of the Finnish National Board of Education has a list of the towns where the test can be taken.
The test demonstrating excellent skills can only be taken in Helsinki.
The test is composed of various kinds of questions which involve reading and listening to texts and answering questions.
It also includes interview, discussion and writing assignments.
The Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate can be substituted with specific completed studies.
For example, a B.A. / M.A. maturity exam (kypsyysnäyte) taken at a university in Finnish or Swedish corresponds to the Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate’s ‘good’ level.
For more information, go to the website of the Finnish National Board of Education.

When you are considering whether to study Finnish or Swedish, take the language that is spoken in your place of residence and neighbourhood into consideration.
If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship, you must be able to speak Finnish or Swedish or to use Finnish sign language.
When you apply for citizenship, you need to attach a certificate of your language proficiency.
For more information on language skill requirements, see the InfoFinland page Official certificate of language proficiency.
At most jobs, you need to know Finnish.
If you want to study in Finland, you will probably need Finnish language skills.
It is worthwhile studying Finnish or Swedish even if you do not intend on staying in the country for long.
Even though Finns generally speak English quite well, knowing Finnish or Swedish will be very useful for you nonetheless.
When you speak the language, you will become acclimatised more easily and will be more at home in Finland.
It will be easier to attend to your affairs with authorities, keep abreast of the news, get to know people and make friends.
The best way to learn a language is to take every opportunity to speak it.
You don’t always have to understand every word; it is enough to understand the most important things.
So be bold and enter situations where you can speak Finnish or Swedish.

Internal communication at the workplace
Usually information about forthcoming events and changes at a workplace is given at meetings.
Attending meetings gives you a chance to influence matters, suggest changes and develop your work.
Every workplace also has other appointed channels of internal communication, such as notice boards, e-mail or mail boxes assigned for employees.
Follow the communications at your workplace.
Breaks
Often a contract of employment gives information about when breaks occur during a working day and how long they are.
Often there is a short coffee break in the morning, a lunch break in the middle of the day and another coffee break in the afternoon.
The length of a lunch break varies according to workplace.
It is a good idea to check the length of the breaks with your supervisor.
Eating during breaks is arranged in different ways at different workplaces: some have their own canteen, while at others employees bring their own food from home.
At some workplaces, employees can buy affordable lunch vouchers that can be used at restaurants close to the workplace.
People do not usually work during lunch.
Taking care of personal business during a working day
It is not permitted to take care of personal affairs during working hours; instead, they have to be dealt with outside working hours.
The number of working hours agreed upon in the contract of employment is binding and the agreed-upon hours have to be performed.
During a break, you can make, for example, important personal calls.
You can also apply for unpaid time off, if the situation requires a longer absence from work.
If for some reason you cannot, for example, get a doctorâ€™s appointment outside working hours, negotiate with your supervisor about your absence and make an agreement about a way to compensate for the time you will be at the doctorâ€™s.
You can visit occupational health care during working hours.
Work-related training
Even if an employee already has the required training for the occupation when they start work, many employers encourage their employees to acquire additional training.
Often it is possible to attend training programmes during working hours, and an employer may pay for the training.
Most employers appreciate their employeeâ€™s desire to advance in their occupation and to learn new skills.
Usually presents are not given at the workplace.
However, on special days (birthdays, marriage, retirement) workmates and the employer usually give a small present or bouquet of flowers to the person whose special day it is.
Working hours and holidays
A normal working day usually lasts eight hours.
An employee can also agree with their employer on different working hours.
In Finland, employees usually do not work a lot of overtime.
People work the hours agreed on in their employment contract.
In Finland, the holiday season begins at the beginning of May.
The number of holidays an employee is entitled to depends on the number of years the employee has worked and when the contract of employment has started.
In addition to paid holidays, you can apply for unpaid leave.
In Finland, holidays are long compared to many other countries.
Well-being at work and work-related recreation
Many workplaces want to support their employeesâ€™ well-being and happiness at work by arranging different kinds of recreational days and workplace celebrations.An employer may also offer employees various opportunities for leisure activities.
Annual holidays
Some days are public holidays in Finland.
Such holidays include:
New Year, 1 January
Twelfth Day, 6 January
Easter: the date varies, in March or April
May Day, 1 May
Midsummer Eve: in June, always on a Friday
Independence Day, 6 December
Christmas Day, 25 December
Boxing Day, 26 December
Read more about these days on the InfoFinland page Finnish holidays.
At some work places, hospitals for example, these public holidays are also working days.
Employees are paid a higher salary for the holidays during which they work.
Check from your collective agreement what the compensation for working during the holidays is.
Register as an unemployed job seeker
If you become unemployed, register yourself at the TE Office no later than on your first day of unemployment.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, you can apply for unemployment benefit.
You may receive unemployment benefit starting from the day you have registered as an unemployed job seeker.
Donâ€™t forget to register immediately also after studying, labour market training or a period of subsidised employment.
Register yourself as a job seeker through the TE Officeâ€™s online service.
Log in using your online banking identifiers or an identity card with a chip.
A TE Office employee will call you if additional clarification is needed.
There is no need for you to call or visit the TE Office unless specifically requested to do so.
If you do not have online banking identifiers or an identity card with a chip, register yourself as a job seeker at your nearest TE Office.
Only the citizens of EU member states, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland can register as job seekers via the online service.
If you are a citizen of some other country, you must register as a job seeker at a TE Office.
When you go to the TE Office take along
all your testimonials of service and study certificates
a passport which shows your residence permit
The TE Office will examine the information you have provided.
The unemployment benefit is subject to certain conditions, and the TE Office will determine whether the conditions are met in your situation.
The TE Office will then issue a statement about the matter to the authority paying the benefit, i.e. the unemployment fund or Kela.
You can ask for advice on matters relating to unemployment benefit at your own TE Office.
You can also call the unemployment counselling services of the TE services:
in Finnish: 0295 020 701

Holidaymaking, studying or working during unemployment
If you start working or studying while you are unemployed, please notify the TE Office.
They will advise you on how this will affect your unemployment benefit.
If you travel in Finland or abroad, make sure you can be reached at all times.
Leave, for example, your phone number and address at the TE Office and tell the staff how long you plan to stay at your travel destination.
A trip abroad is not, however, an acceptable reason for turning down a job offered to you.
If you start business activities while you are unemployed, you may receive unemployment benefit for the first 4 months.
Qualifying period
You may lose your right to daily unemployment allowance for a prescribed time if your unemployment is due to a self-inflicted reason.
This can happen, for example, if:
you do not apply for a job proposed to you by the TE Office
you do not accept a job that is offered to you
you resign from you work yourself without a solid reason.
The qualifying period length varies from 15 to 90 days.
The length depends on the cause of the qualifying period.
In some cases, you may lose your right to unemployment benefit for the time being.
In Finland, there are different ways to describe the level of a language course.
Often the rating scale of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEF) (eurooppalainen viitekehys, EVK) is used.
This scale contains the following levels:
levels A1 and A2: basic language skills (peruskielitaito)
levels B1 and B2: language skills of an independent user (itsenäisen kielenkäyttäjän kielitaito)
levels C1 and C2: language skills of a proficient user (taitavan kielenkäyttäjän kielitaito)
These levels are further divided into sublevels.
For example, level A1 comprises courses A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3, and level A2 courses A2.1 and A2.2.
The Finnish National Board of Education’s (Opetushallitus) website offers more information about what the different levels mean in practice.
You can also ask directly at an educational establishment.
The InfoFinland web page Official certificate of language proficiency provides information about how to compare course levels to the level of the National Certificate of Language Proficiency test (yleinen kielitutkinto).

Honesty, punctuality and equality are appreciated in Finland.
This shows in all Finnish culture, including working life.
This page describes Finnish working culture.
Laws and agreements on working life
Finnish working life has many rules that the employee and employer must follow.
The legislation and collective agreements determine, for example, minimum wages, working hours, holidays, sick pay and the terms of dismissal.
Sometimes, the employer may ask the employee to work overtime.
According to law, the employer must pay supplemented wages for overtime.
You can also get compensated as time off work.
You have the right to refuse to work overtime.
More information on the rights and obligations of employees in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Employee’s rights and obligations.
linkkiSAK :
Working in FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Estonian _ French _ Somali _ Spanish _ Chinese _ Arabic
Learn Finnish or Swedish
You can improve your language skills in courses or on the job.
Do not hesitate to speak Finnish or Swedish with your co-workers.
Read more about studying languages on the InfoFinland page Finnish and Swedish.
Equality and equal opportunities in working life
According to Finnish law, all kinds of discrimination at workplaces is prohibited.
Employers must ensure that there is equality and equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Equality and equal opportunities in working life.
Initiative and responsibility
At Finnish workplaces, supervisors do not monitor their employees’ work continually.
Employers ask for their employees’ opinions and these are taken into account in job planning.
Work is usually arranged and agreed on at common meetings and jointly agreed matters are adhered to.
A supervisor gives an employee their tasks and expects the employee to decide on the details of the work independently.
If an employee does not know how to perform the given task or cannot do it, they ask their co-workers or the supervisor directly for instructions.
Reliability and observing timetables
In Finnish working culture, it is important to adhere to the things that have been agreed upon.
When something has been decided together, the employees and employer assume that everyone will do what has been decided.
Observing timetables is also important in Finland.
You must arrive at work promptly at the agreed-upon time.
When the agreement is 8:00, this means exactly 8:00, not 8:10.
Being late is impolite because other people have to wait for the one who is late.
If you know that you will be late for work, tell your supervisor about it.
Many workplaces have adopted flexible working hours which means that you can come to work, for example, between 7 and 9 and leave between 15 and 17.
If a workplace uses flexible working hours, employees themselves have to make sure that they work for the length of time that has been agreed upon.
Style of communication
Finns usually speak out, and speaking out is not considered impolite in Finland.
Saying what you mean is also normal in working life.
For example, if you do not have enough time to complete a task, it is best to say so to your supervisor.
At meetings, the usual procedure is to get straight to the point after greeting everybody.
In Finnish working culture, the form of address is very informal.
At most workplaces, all employees address each other using first names regardless of their position.
The effect of religion on working life
Many Finns are Christians but not very religious.
However, many Christian customs are still observed in Finnish culture.
In working life, the effect of religion can be seen in many of the holidays.
Christian religious holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are statutory holidays.
Read more on InfoFinland page Finnish holidays.
Religious customs or rituals do not belong at a Finnish workplace.
Some places of work have arranged a place for praying, if employees have asked for one.
However, most workplaces do not provide for such practices.
If an employee wants to take a moment, for example, for prayer in the middle of a working day, this must take place in connection with the agreed-upon breaks.
Signs of religions in outward appearance, such as head scarves, are permitted in Finland, but operative rules on working clothes have to be observed.
This is due to task-related work safety and hygiene decrees.
You can read more about the values and customers of Finnish society on the page Finnish customs.
An employer has the right to:
hire an employee
manage work and give instructions and regulations relating to work management
dismiss and dissolve a contract of employment within the limits provided by law
An employer has the obligation to:
observe the law, contracts and agreements
treat employees equally regardless of their origin, religion, sex, age or political views
look after their employees’ safety and occupational health
provide their employees with a written account of the central conditions of work
promote a good working environment, boost employees’ performance in their work and contribute to their occupational development
Collective agreement
An employer must observe the collective agreement.
For example, they cannot pay less remuneration than the agreement specifies.
Incomes Register
The Incomes Register is a database in which employers report the salaries paid for their employees.
The information must be reported no later than five days after salary payment.
The information must be submitted to the Incomes Register electronically:
directly through the payment system if it has a built-in technical connection to the Incomes Register, or
through the Incomes Register online service, which you can access using your online banking credentials or other means of electronic authentication.
Salary information can be reported on a paper form only in special cases.
Read more about the Incomes Register and how to submit a report on the Incomes Register website.

Incomes RegisterFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Estonian _ Chinese
Accident insurance
An employer must take out an accident insurance policy (tapaturmavakuutus) for their employees.
This must be done every time an employment contract begins.
An employee may obtain compensation when an accident at work has taken place.
This compensation may occur as daily allowance for medical treatment expenses and loss of earnings, workers’ compensation pension, compensation for an injury caused by the accident, rehabilitation or, in fatal cases, survivors' pension for relatives.
In addition to statutory insurance policies, an employer may also take out various voluntary insurance policies for their employees.
It is a good idea to discuss with your employer what kinds of insurance policies they have taken out for their employees.
Testimonial of service
When an employee’s contract of employment expires they are entitled to a written testimonial of service from their employer.

There are a lot of different possibilities to study Finnish in Finland.
Various courses are organised for both children and adults.
Finnish lessons for adults
You can find information about Finnish language courses, for example, at community colleges, adult education centres, universities and summer universities.
Ask the guidance services for immigrants, the authorities at your locality’s Department of Education or the student counsellors of local educational establishments for more information.
For some areas, the course information has been collected into one site.
For example, information on Finnish courses held in the Helsinki, Tampere and Turku regions is available at the Finnishcourses.fi service.
Courses at educational establishments usually begin in August or September as well as in January.
Language courses are often very full.
That is why it is important to enrol well before the course starts.

Finnish lessons for children
Children learn new languages quickly, although it may seem difficult at first.
They can be taught Finnish at their day-care centre, preschool and school.
This tuition is called Finnish as a second language, i.e. S2 teaching.
A child or young person may also participate in preparatory education.
It is intended for pupils who do not know much Finnish yet.
During preparatory education, the child or young person studies Finnish and some other subjects.
Preparatory education is intended for children between 7 and 16 years of age.
It usually lasts for one year.
After this, the student is transferred to a normal class.

Finland has two pension systems which complement each other:
Earnings-related pension is earned by your paid work and entrepreneurial activities.
It is the responsibility of an employer to take out a retirement pension insurance policy for all their employees and to pay the insurance premiums.
An entrepreneur takes care of their own insurance premiums.
National pensions and guarantee pensions are meant for those pensioners who have no earnings-related pension or whose pension is very small.
Both pension systems include old-age pension and disability pension.
You will be eligible to receive a national pension once you have turned 65.
The age at which you can receive earnings-related pension depends on your year of birth.
Check your pension age in your pension record or with your pension institution.
A person who is incapable of work may receive disability pension before their old-age pension begins.
A pensioner can also work, if he/she so chooses to do.
If you are on old-age pension, your earned income will not have an effect on the amount of pension you receive.
In Finland pensions are taxable income.
Employers and employees finance earnings-related pension cover together.
The employer collects their employees’ contribution from their pay and renders this and their own share of the insurance fee to the pension institution.
The amount of earnings-related pension depends on how long you have worked and how high your salary has been.
Earnings-related pension companies, pension funds and pension foundations manage earning-related pensions.
The Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK) takes care of issues related to pension security in a centralised manner.
linkkiFinnish Centre for Pensions:
Earnings-related pensionFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Check your accumulated pension from your pension record
Your pension institution will send you a pension record at regular intervals.
The record presents an estimate of how much pension you have accumulated.
You can also order a pension record from your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
Keep an eye on the accumulated pension in your pension record to ensure that it has been calculated correctly.
If there is an error in the information, contact your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
Keep any testimonials of service for verification.
Payslips should also be kept.
Ordering a pension recordFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Estonian
You can apply for national pension if you have not accumulated earnings-related pension or if it is very small.The amount of national pension is affected by how long you have lived or worked in Finland.
In addition to this, your family situation and other continuous pension income affect the amount of national pension paid.
Kela handles national pensions and guarantee pensions.
You can apply for national pension and guarantee pension if you are covered by Finnish social security and have resided in Finland for at least 3 years since you turned 16.
The time you have lived in another EU or EEC country may also be partially considered.
Guarantee pension provides pensioners with minimum livelihood.
The amount of guarantee pension you will receive is the difference between the other pensions you might receive and the full guarantee pension.
If the sum total of your other pensions is more that the full guarantee pension, you are not eligible for guarantee pension.
More information on guarantee pension is available at Kela.
In some cases, you can also receive a national pension before turning 65.
More information on early national pension and additional days related to national pension can be obtained from Kela.

You can also apply for old-age pension and guarantee pension by calling Kela.
Kela’s customer service number for pension matters is 020 692 202.
Pension from abroad
If you have resided or worked in other EU countries or in countries with which Finland has a social security agreement, you might be eligible to receive pension from these countries.
You can apply for pension from these countries at the same time as you apply for Finnish earnings-related or national pension.
Attach to your application a separate form Residence and Employment Abroad.
You can print the form at the website of Kela or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
If you have worked in a country with which Finland does not have a social security agreement, you must find out for yourself if you are eligible to receive pension from that country.
If you are entitled to receive pension, you must apply for it yourself.
The Finnish Centre for Pension will give you advice for applying for pension abroad.
Read more on the website of the Finnish Centre for Pension.
You can also ask for advice at Kela.

Paying pension abroad
Earnings-related pension paid abroad
If you leave Finland, you will be paid earnings-related pension accrued in Finland when you reach retirement age.
Earnings-related pension can be paid to any country.
It is important that you have a testimonial of service for each contract of employment you have had in Finland.
Payslips should also be kept
The way in which you should apply for pension to be paid abroad depends on your country of residence.
You can contact your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions for advice.
Before applying for pension, request a pension record from your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
The pension record indicates how much pension you have accumulated in Finland.
Kela pensions paid abroad
Always notify Kela if you move abroad permanently or reside in a foreign country for more than three months.
If your residence abroad is temporary, i.e. less than one year, Kela will usually continue to pay your pension normally.
In some cases Kela may continue to pay for example old-age and family pension to some countries even if you move there for more than a year.
These countries include for example other EU and EEA member states and some of the countries with which Finland has a social security agreement.
Guarantee pension will not be paid if you move abroad for more than a year.
Kela website contains further information on incidences when you can receive Kela pensions abroad.
You can also ask about your situation at a Kela office or telephone service.
Partial early old-age pension
If you have turned 61, you can enter partial retirement before your minimum old-age pension age.
This arrangement is called partial early old-age pension.
You can choose whether to receive 25% of 50% of your monthly earning-related pension amount.
If you wish, you can continue working full-time or agree upon shorter working hours with your employer.
You can also stop working altogether.
Please note that the partial early old-age pension will permanently reduce the ultimate amount of your old-age pension.
Ask your pension institution for more information.
If you are ill for a long time, you will normally receive sickness allowance for about a year.
If you cannot return to work due to an illness or injury, you can apply for disability pension (työkyvyttömyyseläke) or rehabilitation subsidy ( kuntoutustuki). Rehabilitation subsidy is a fixed-term disability pension.
Apply for disability pension with a form available from Kela.
You must attach medical certificate B to your application.
Kela and your authorised pension provider will evaluate whether you are fit for work and whether you would benefit from rehabilitation.
Further information on disability pension and rehabilitation subsidy is available from Kela, your pension institution or from your occupational health care provider.
If you are on disability pension, your earned income will affect the amount of pension you receive.
Notify Kela and your authorised pension provider if you go to work.
If your earned income per month is sufficiently large, you can let your pension lie.
This means that you can take a break from collecting your pension.
The break can be at least three months and at most two years long.
You will not lose your right to receive disability pension during the time that you let your pension lie.
Other benefits for pensioners
In addition to pension, Kela may pay pensioners with low income housing allowance for pensioners.
More information on housing allowance for pensioners is available on the Kela website.
Kela may pay care allowance for pensioners for individuals with long-term illness or disabled people.
Ask for more information at Kela.
Discounts for pensioners
After you have retired, you can receive pensioner discounts, for example, for train, plane and bus fares in Finland.
Persons of 65 years old or over receive a discount on a travel fare by presenting their identity card.
A pensioner under 65 years of age can receive discounts by presenting their identity card and earnings-related pension card or national pension card.
Check the conditions of pensioner discounts from a ticket office.
You can also receive pensioner discounts, for example, for recreational sports and cultural activities.
The tax return contains information on the income, taxes and deductions of the previous year.
Check the information in the tax return.
The final taxation is made on the basis of the information in the tax return.
If all the information is correct and nothing is missing, you do not need to do anything.
If the information is not correct or something is missing, complete and correct the tax return in the MyTax online service.
You can use the online service if you have Finnish online banking credentials or the Mobile Certificate.
If you do not make corrections in the MyTax online service, get separate correction forms from the Tax Administration website or tax office.
Send the completed forms by post.
Remember to check the tax return and make any necessary changes by the last return date.
Tax decision
Tax decision (verotuspäätös) is a calculation of the final amount of taxes.
Taxes have been withheld from your salary or other income on the basis of your tax card.
This is called withholding tax (ennakonpidätys).
The amount of withholding tax is based on your estimate of your income.
The amount of tax is checked afterwards on the basis of your actual income and deductions.
You will receive a tax decision together with a pre-completed tax return.
If you do not make any changes to the tax return, the tax decision will remain in effect.
If you make changes to the tax return, you will receive a new tax decision later.
Remember also to check the new tax decision.
Retain the tax decision and the specification section which you will receive in the spring with your tax return.
If you order a new specification section, it will be subject to a fee.
linkkiFinnish Tax Administration:
Tax return and tax decisionFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Deductions
Deductions (vähennys) in your taxation will reduce the amount of tax you must pay.
The Tax Administration makes some of the deductions automatically but some of them you must claim yourself.
Deductions may include the following, for example:
tax credit for domestic help or household expenses
deduction for commuting expenses, i.e. daily travel from home to work
interest on a mortgage
You can deduct the interest on your mortgage when you have taken the mortgage for your permanent home.
You can also deduct the interest on your mortgage if your permanent home is located abroad.
If you have a mortgage from a Finnish bank, the Tax Administration will receive information on the mortgage directly from the bank.
If you have a mortgage from a foreign bank, you must report the information on the mortgage to the Tax Administration yourself.
You can report any deductions when you order a new tax card.
In that case, the deductions will be taken into account in your tax percentage.
You can also claim deductions afterwards using a tax return.
In that case, you will receive the deductions in arrears as tax refunds.

Deductions in taxationFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Tax refund and back tax
The tax decision indicates whether the correct amount of taxes has been withheld from your salary.
If you have paid too much tax, you will receive a tax refund (veronpalautus).
If you have paid too little tax, you will have to pay back tax (jäännösvero).
A tax refund will be paid directly to your bank account.
Report your bank account number to the Tax Administration either in the online service or using a paper form.
You can receive the tax refund to a Finnish or a foreign bank account.
If you have to pay back tax, you will receive a bank transfer form along with the tax decision.
The bank transfer form contains the amount of back tax, a bank account number, a due date and a reference number.
You also have to pay interest on the back tax after a certain period.

Approximately 90% of Finns speak Finnish as their native language.
Approximately 5% of Finns speak Swedish as their native language.
When you are considering whether to study Finnish or Swedish, take the language that is spoken in your place of residence and neighbourhood into consideration.
If you want to apply for Finnish citizenship, you must be able to speak Finnish or Swedish or to use Finnish sign language.
When you apply for citizenship, you need to attach a certificate of your language proficiency.
For more information on language skill requirements, see the InfoFinland page Official certificate of language proficiency.
At most jobs, you need to know Finnish.
If you want to study in Finland, you will probably need Finnish language skills.
It is worthwhile studying Finnish or Swedish even if you do not intend on staying in the country for long.
Even though Finns generally speak English quite well, knowing Finnish or Swedish will be very useful for you nonetheless.
When you speak the language, you will become acclimatised more easily and will be more at home in Finland.
It will be easier to attend to your affairs with authorities, keep abreast of the news, get to know people and make friends.
The best way to learn a language is to take every opportunity to speak it.
You don’t always have to understand every word; it is enough to understand the most important things.
So be bold and enter situations where you can speak Finnish or Swedish.

You need to have a tax card (verokortti) if you receive a salary or other income in Finland.
The tax card shows your tax rate (veroprosentti).
The employer will then know how much tax to withhold from your salary.
Your tax rate depends on the amount of your income.

If you have several employers
If you have several employers, show your tax card to all of them.
The same tax card is intended for all employers.
You will pay the same amount of tax on all your income.
The tax card has an income limit according to which the tax rate is calculated.
Be sure to keep track of your income.
If you receive more income than you have reported, you will exceed your income limit.
If you exceed your income limit, order a new tax card.
Tax number
You need to have a tax number (veronumero), if you work at a construction or installation site in Finland.
The tax number is used to check that all workers are registered with the Finnish Tax Administration.
Your tax number must be listed on your name tag with your photo, which will be provided for you by your employer.
You are not allowed to work on a construction site without this tag.
You will receive the tax number from the tax office at the same time that you collect a tax card.
If you already have a Finnish personal identity code and a tax card, you will find the tax number in your tax card.

Internal communication at the workplace
Usually information about forthcoming events and changes at a workplace is given at meetings.
Attending meetings gives you a chance to influence matters, suggest changes and develop your work.
Every workplace also has other appointed channels of internal communication, such as notice boards, e-mail or mail boxes assigned for employees.
Follow the communications at your workplace.
Breaks
Often a contract of employment gives information about when breaks occur during a working day and how long they are.
Often there is a short coffee break in the morning, a lunch break in the middle of the day and another coffee break in the afternoon.
The length of a lunch break varies according to workplace.
It is a good idea to check the length of the breaks with your supervisor.
Eating during breaks is arranged in different ways at different workplaces: some have their own canteen, while at others employees bring their own food from home.
At some workplaces, employees can buy affordable lunch vouchers that can be used at restaurants close to the workplace.
People do not usually work during lunch.
Taking care of personal business during a working day
It is not permitted to take care of personal affairs during working hours; instead, they have to be dealt with outside working hours.
The number of working hours agreed upon in the contract of employment is binding and the agreed-upon hours have to be performed.
During a break, you can make, for example, important personal calls.
You can also apply for unpaid time off, if the situation requires a longer absence from work.
If for some reason you cannot, for example, get a doctor’s appointment outside working hours, negotiate with your supervisor about your absence and make an agreement about a way to compensate for the time you will be at the doctor’s.
You can visit occupational health care during working hours.
Work-related training
Even if an employee already has the required training for the occupation when they start work, many employers encourage their employees to acquire additional training.
Often it is possible to attend training programmes during working hours, and an employer may pay for the training.
Most employers appreciate their employee’s desire to advance in their occupation and to learn new skills.
Usually presents are not given at the workplace.
However, on special days (birthdays, marriage, retirement) workmates and the employer usually give a small present or bouquet of flowers to the person whose special day it is.
Working hours and holidays
A normal working day usually lasts eight hours.
An employee can also agree with their employer on different working hours.
In Finland, employees usually do not work a lot of overtime.
People work the hours agreed on in their employment contract.
In Finland, the holiday season begins at the beginning of May.
The number of holidays an employee is entitled to depends on the number of years the employee has worked and when the contract of employment has started.
In addition to paid holidays, you can apply for unpaid leave.
In Finland, holidays are long compared to many other countries.
Well-being at work and work-related recreation
Many workplaces want to support their employees’ well-being and happiness at work by arranging different kinds of recreational days and workplace celebrations.An employer may also offer employees various opportunities for leisure activities.
Annual holidays
Some days are public holidays in Finland.
Such holidays include:
New Year, 1 January
Twelfth Day, 6 January
Easter: the date varies, in March or April
May Day, 1 May
Midsummer Eve: in June, always on a Friday
Independence Day, 6 December
Christmas Day, 25 December
Boxing Day, 26 December
Read more about these days on the InfoFinland page Finnish holidays.
At some work places, hospitals for example, these public holidays are also working days.
Employees are paid a higher salary for the holidays during which they work.
Check from your collective agreement what the compensation for working during the holidays is.
Register as an unemployed job seeker
If you become unemployed, register yourself at the TE Office no later than on your first day of unemployment.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, you can apply for unemployment benefit.
You may receive unemployment benefit starting from the day you have registered as an unemployed job seeker.
Don’t forget to register immediately also after studying, labour market training or a period of subsidised employment.
Register yourself as a job seeker through the TE Office’s online service.
Log in using your online banking identifiers or an identity card with a chip.
A TE Office employee will call you if additional clarification is needed.
There is no need for you to call or visit the TE Office unless specifically requested to do so.
If you do not have online banking identifiers or an identity card with a chip, register yourself as a job seeker at your nearest TE Office.
Only the citizens of EU member states, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland can register as job seekers via the online service.
If you are a citizen of some other country, you must register as a job seeker at a TE Office.
When you go to the TE Office take along
all your testimonials of service and study certificates
a passport which shows your residence permit
The TE Office will examine the information you have provided.
The unemployment benefit is subject to certain conditions, and the TE Office will determine whether the conditions are met in your situation.
The TE Office will then issue a statement about the matter to the authority paying the benefit, i.e. the unemployment fund or Kela.
You can ask for advice on matters relating to unemployment benefit at your own TE Office.
You can also call the unemployment counselling services of the TE services:

Holidaymaking, studying or working during unemployment
If you start working or studying while you are unemployed, please notify the TE Office.
They will advise you on how this will affect your unemployment benefit.
If you travel in Finland or abroad, make sure you can be reached at all times.
Leave, for example, your phone number and address at the TE Office and tell the staff how long you plan to stay at your travel destination.
A trip abroad is not, however, an acceptable reason for turning down a job offered to you.
If you start business activities while you are unemployed, you may receive unemployment benefit for the first 4 months.
Qualifying period
You may lose your right to daily unemployment allowance for a prescribed time if your unemployment is due to a self-inflicted reason.
This can happen, for example, if:
you do not apply for a job proposed to you by the TE Office
you do not accept a job that is offered to you
you resign from you work yourself without a solid reason.
The qualifying period length varies from 15 to 90 days.
The length depends on the cause of the qualifying period.
In some cases, you may lose your right to unemployment benefit for the time being.
In Finland, you pay income tax (tulovero) on your salary.
You must also pay taxes on the following income:
payment for labour or service
business income
unemployment allowance
parental allowance
pensions
study grant
With tax money, the state and municipalities pay for the following, for example:
health care
education
day care
defence
In Finland, taxation is progressive.
This means that the tax rate (the share of taxes) is larger for a larger salary than for a smaller salary.
A withholding tax percentage (veroprosentti) is calculated separately for each person in Finland.
The spouse’s income does not affect your withholding tax percentage.
You can estimate your own tax percentage using the Tax Administration’s calculator.
The employer withholds taxes directly from your salary.
For that purpose, the employer must have your tax card.
The tax that is withheld directly from your salary is the withholding tax (ennakonpidätys).
After each year, the Tax Administration calculates whether a sufficient amount of taxes has been withheld from the income.
If you have paid too much in tax, you will receive a tax refund (veronpalautus).
If you have not paid enough in tax, you will have to pay back tax (jäännösvero).
Further information: Tax return and tax decision.
Check your salary slip and tax return (veroilmoitus) to ensure that your employer has withheld taxes from your salary.
Retain your salary slips.
If the tax has not been withheld, you will have to pay it in arrears.
In addition to taxes, your employer will withhold insurance payments from your salary for unemployment and sickness, for example.

Taxation when you come to work in Finland
If you come from abroad to work in Finland, your taxation depends on how long you will stay in Finland.
Taxation also depends on whether your employer is a Finnish or a foreign company.
If you reside in Finland for more than six months, you must usually pay taxes on your salary in Finland.
Usually, you must also pay the obligatory insurance payments in Finland.
You need a Finnish personal identity code and a tax card.
The tax rate is calculated on the basis of the income for the whole year.
You will be granted tax deductions on the same basis as everyone else who lives permanently in Finland.
If you reside in Finland for six months at the most and your employer is a foreign company, you do not usually need to pay taxes in Finland.
If your employer is Finnish or your foreign employer has an office in Finland, you will pay taxes in Finland.
You can apply for progressive taxation if you live in a country that belongs to the European Economic Area or a country with which Finland has a tax agreement.
Otherwise, you will pay 35% tax at source (lähdevero) on your salary and you must have a tax-at-source card.
You must apply for a tax-at-source card using a paper form.
For progressive taxation, you must have a non-resident’s tax card (rajoitetusti verovelvollisen verokortti).
You can obtain it from a tax office.
You can also apply for progressive taxation afterwards.
You will also have to pay insurance payments if you are not insured in the country in which you reside permanently.
If you already have an insurance cover from another country, you need to have a certificate of the insurance (A1/E101).
When you move away from Finland, remember to submit a notification of the move to the Local Register Office.
This will ensure that your tax return will be sent to the correct address.
When you are moving to Finland, you can find more information in the section Moving to Finland.

Honesty, punctuality and equality are appreciated in Finland.
This shows in all Finnish culture, including working life.
This page describes Finnish working culture.
You can read more about the values and customers of Finnish society on the page Finnish customs.
Learn Finnish or Swedish
You can improve your language skills in courses or on the job.
Do not hesitate to speak Finnish or Swedish with your co-workers.
Read more about studying languages on the InfoFinland page Finnish and Swedish.
Equality and equal opportunities in working life
According to Finnish law, all kinds of discrimination at workplaces is prohibited.
Employers must ensure that there is equality and equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Equality and equal opportunities in working life.
Initiative and responsibility
At Finnish workplaces, supervisors do not monitor their employees’ work continually.
Employers ask for their employees’ opinions and these are taken into account in job planning.
Work is usually arranged and agreed on at common meetings and jointly agreed matters are adhered to.
A supervisor gives an employee their tasks and expects the employee to decide on the details of the work independently.
If an employee does not know how to perform the given task or cannot do it, they ask their co-workers or the supervisor directly for instructions.
Reliability and observing timetables
In Finnish working culture, it is important to adhere to the things that have been agreed upon.
When something has been decided together, the employees and employer assume that everyone will do what has been decided.
Observing timetables is also important in Finland.
You must arrive at work promptly at the agreed-upon time.
When the agreement is 8:00, this means exactly 8:00, not 8:10.
Being late is impolite because other people have to wait for the one who is late.
If you know that you will be late for work, tell your supervisor about it.
Many workplaces have adopted flexible working hours which means that you can come to work, for example, between 7 and 9 and leave between 15 and 17.
If a workplace uses flexible working hours, employees themselves have to make sure that they work for the length of time that has been agreed upon.
Style of communication
Finns usually speak out, and speaking out is not considered impolite in Finland.
Saying what you mean is also normal in working life.
For example, if you do not have enough time to complete a task, it is best to say so to your supervisor.
At meetings, the usual procedure is to get straight to the point after greeting everybody.
In Finnish working culture, the form of address is very informal.
At most workplaces, all employees address each other using first names regardless of their position.
The effect of religion on working life
Many Finns are Christians but not very religious.
However, many Christian customs are still observed in Finnish culture.
In working life, the effect of religion can be seen in many of the holidays.
Christian religious holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are statutory holidays.
Read more on InfoFinland page Finnish holidays.
Religious customs or rituals do not belong at a Finnish workplace.
Some places of work have arranged a place for praying, if employees have asked for one.
However, most workplaces do not provide for such practices.
If an employee wants to take a moment, for example, for prayer in the middle of a working day, this must take place in connection with the agreed-upon breaks.
Signs of religions in outward appearance, such as head scarves, are permitted in Finland, but operative rules on working clothes have to be observed.
This is due to task-related work safety and hygiene decrees.

An employer has the right to:
hire an employee
manage work and give instructions and regulations relating to work management
dismiss and dissolve a contract of employment within the limits provided by law
An employer has the obligation to:
observe the law, contracts and agreements
treat employees equally regardless of their origin, religion, sex, age or political views
look after their employees’ safety and occupational health
provide their employees with a written account of the central conditions of work
promote a good working environment, boost employees’ performance in their work and contribute to their occupational development
Collective agreement
An employer must observe the collective agreement.
For example, they cannot pay less remuneration than the agreement specifies.
Incomes Register
The Incomes Register is a database in which employers report the salaries paid for their employees.
The information must be reported no later than five days after salary payment.
The information must be submitted to the Incomes Register electronically:
directly through the payment system if it has a built-in technical connection to the Incomes Register, or
through the Incomes Register online service, which you can access using your online banking credentials or other means of electronic authentication.
Salary information can be reported on a paper form only in special cases.
Read more about the Incomes Register and how to submit a report on the Incomes Register website.

Accident insurance
An employer must take out an accident insurance policy (tapaturmavakuutus) for their employees.
This must be done every time an employment contract begins.
An employee may obtain compensation when an accident at work has taken place.
This compensation may occur as daily allowance for medical treatment expenses and loss of earnings, workers’ compensation pension, compensation for an injury caused by the accident, rehabilitation or, in fatal cases, survivors' pension for relatives.
In addition to statutory insurance policies, an employer may also take out various voluntary insurance policies for their employees.
It is a good idea to discuss with your employer what kinds of insurance policies they have taken out for their employees.
Testimonial of service
When an employee’s contract of employment expires they are entitled to a written testimonial of service from their employer.

Entrepreneur’s unemployment benefit
An entrepreneur is also entitled to unemployment benefit.
An entrepreneur is unemployed when they have ended their business activities or sold their share of the company.
Entrepreneurship can end in selling or dissolving the company, in bankruptcy, liquidation, or because of a divorce.
An entrepreneur is also considered unemployed if business operations have been suspended for at least four months.
If you need to close down your business, you should immediately register yourself as unemployed in the TE Office online service.
You are entitled to unemployment benefit starting from the day you registered your unemployment at the TE Office.

If you want to be entitled to earnings-related unemployment allowance, you must join the unemployment fund for entrepreneurs (yrittäjien työttömyyskassa).
If your business operations end, you may then apply for earnings-related daily allowance (ansiosidonnainen päiväraha) from the unemployment fund.
To receive earnings-related daily allowance from the unemployment fund, you must have been an entrepreneur and a member of the fund for a required time period before becoming unemployed.
Earnings-related unemployment allowance is larger than basic unemployment allowance or labour market subsidy.
Its size depends on the amount of earned income you have registered in the entrepreneur’s retirement pension insurance.

Basic unemployment allowance
Kela can pay basic unemployment allowance (peruspäiväraha) to an unemployed entrepreneur who is not a member of an unemployment fund.
You may receive basic unemployment allowance, if you meet an entrepreneur’s condition regarding previous employment and are covered by Finnish social security.
The Kela website includes a calculator that can be used to estimate if you meet an entrepreneur’s condition regarding previous employment.
Labour market subsidy
If you are not eligible to receive basic unemployment allowance, but are covered by Finnish social security you can apply for labour market subsidy.
Labour market subsidy is a means-tested benefit, meaning that any other income and your overall situation will influence the amount of labour market subsidy you receive.
Entrepreneur’s occupational health care (työterveyshuolto)
An entrepreneur and other persons working for themselves can organise occupational health care for themselves if they like.
An entrepreneur is not obliged to arrange occupational health care for themselves. However, an entrepreneur must organise occupational health care for their employees.
This can be arranged at the local health centre (terveyskeskus) or, for example, a private clinic.

When an entrepreneur falls ill
If you fall ill, Kela may pay you sickness allowance (sairauspäiväraha) which compensates for the loss of earnings due to incapacity for work if this incapacity continues for less than a year.
Payments of daily allowance begin after the qualifying period for benefit (omavastuuaika).
An entrepreneur’s qualifying period for benefit is usually the first day of illness plus the following three weekdays.

Finland has two pension systems which complement each other:
Earnings-related pension is earned by your paid work and entrepreneurial activities.
It is the responsibility of an employer to take out a retirement pension insurance policy for all their employees and to pay the insurance premiums.
An entrepreneur takes care of their own insurance premiums.
National pensions and guarantee pensions are meant for those pensioners who have no earnings-related pension or whose pension is very small.
Both pension systems include old-age pension and disability pension.
You will be eligible to receive a national pension once you have turned 65.
The age at which you can receive earnings-related pension depends on your year of birth.
Check your pension age in your pension record or with your pension institution.
A person who is incapable of work may receive disability pension before their old-age pension begins.
A pensioner can also work, if he/she so chooses to do.
If you are on old-age pension, your earned income will not have an effect on the amount of pension you receive.
In Finland pensions are taxable income.
Employers and employees finance earnings-related pension cover together.
The employer collects their employees’ contribution from their pay and renders this and their own share of the insurance fee to the pension institution.
The amount of earnings-related pension depends on how long you have worked and how high your salary has been.
Earnings-related pension companies, pension funds and pension foundations manage earning-related pensions.
The Finnish Centre for Pensions (ETK) takes care of issues related to pension security in a centralised manner.

Keep an eye on the accumulated pension in your pension record to ensure that it has been calculated correctly.
If there is an error in the information, contact your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
Keep any testimonials of service for verification.
Payslips should also be kept.
Ordering a pension recordFinnish _ Swedish _ English _ Russian _ Estonian
You can apply for national pension if you have not accumulated earnings-related pension or if it is very small.The amount of national pension is affected by how long you have lived or worked in Finland.
In addition to this, your family situation and other continuous pension income affect the amount of national pension paid.
Kela handles national pensions and guarantee pensions.
You can apply for national pension and guarantee pension if you are covered by Finnish social security and have resided in Finland for at least 3 years since you turned 16.
The time you have lived in another EU or EEC country may also be partially considered.
Guarantee pension provides pensioners with minimum livelihood.
The amount of guarantee pension you will receive is the difference between the other pensions you might receive and the full guarantee pension.
If the sum total of your other pensions is more that the full guarantee pension, you are not eligible for guarantee pension.
More information on guarantee pension is available at Kela.
In some cases, you can also receive a national pension before turning 65.
More information on early national pension and additional days related to national pension can be obtained from Kela.

Pension from abroad
If you have resided or worked in other EU countries or in countries with which Finland has a social security agreement, you might be eligible to receive pension from these countries.
You can apply for pension from these countries at the same time as you apply for Finnish earnings-related or national pension.
Attach to your application a separate form Residence and Employment Abroad.
You can print the form at the website of Kela or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
If you have worked in a country with which Finland does not have a social security agreement, you must find out for yourself if you are eligible to receive pension from that country.

Paying pension abroad
Earnings-related pension paid abroad
If you leave Finland, you will be paid earnings-related pension accrued in Finland when you reach retirement age.
Earnings-related pension can be paid to any country.
It is important that you have a testimonial of service for each contract of employment you have had in Finland.
Payslips should also be kept
The way in which you should apply for pension to be paid abroad depends on your country of residence.
You can contact your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions for advice.
Before applying for pension, request a pension record from your pension institution or the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
The pension record indicates how much pension you have accumulated in Finland.
Kela pensions paid abroad
Always notify Kela if you move abroad permanently or reside in a foreign country for more than three months.
If your residence abroad is temporary, i.e. less than one year, Kela will usually continue to pay your pension normally.
In some cases Kela may continue to pay for example old-age and family pension to some countries even if you move there for more than a year.
These countries include for example other EU and EEA member states and some of the countries with which Finland has a social security agreement.
Guarantee pension will not be paid if you move abroad for more than a year.
Kela website contains further information on incidences when you can receive Kela pensions abroad.
You can also ask about your situation at a Kela office or telephone service.
Partial early old-age pension
If you have turned 61, you can enter partial retirement before your minimum old-age pension age.
This arrangement is called partial early old-age pension.
You can choose whether to receive 25% of 50% of your monthly earning-related pension amount.
If you wish, you can continue working full-time or agree upon shorter working hours with your employer.
You can also stop working altogether.
Please note that the partial early old-age pension will permanently reduce the ultimate amount of your old-age pension.
Ask your pension institution for more information.
If you are ill for a long time, you will normally receive sickness allowance for about a year.
If you cannot return to work due to an illness or injury, you can apply for disability pension (työkyvyttömyyseläke) or rehabilitation subsidy ( kuntoutustuki). Rehabilitation subsidy is a fixed-term disability pension.
Apply for disability pension with a form available from Kela.
You must attach medical certificate B to your application.
Kela and your authorised pension provider will evaluate whether you are fit for work and whether you would benefit from rehabilitation.
Further information on disability pension and rehabilitation subsidy is available from Kela, your pension institution or from your occupational health care provider.
If you are on disability pension, your earned income will affect the amount of pension you receive.
Notify Kela and your authorised pension provider if you go to work.
If your earned income per month is sufficiently large, you can let your pension lie.
This means that you can take a break from collecting your pension.
The break can be at least three months and at most two years long.
You will not lose your right to receive disability pension during the time that you let your pension lie.
Other benefits for pensioners
In addition to pension, Kela may pay pensioners with low income housing allowance for pensioners.
More information on housing allowance for pensioners is available on the Kela website.
Kela may pay care allowance for pensioners for individuals with long-term illness or disabled people.
Ask for more information at Kela.
Discounts for pensioners
After you have retired, you can receive pensioner discounts, for example, for train, plane and bus fares in Finland.
Persons of 65 years old or over receive a discount on a travel fare by presenting their identity card.
A pensioner under 65 years of age can receive discounts by presenting their identity card and earnings-related pension card or national pension card.
Check the conditions of pensioner discounts from a ticket office.

Tax decision
Tax decision (verotuspäätös) is a calculation of the final amount of taxes.
Taxes have been withheld from your salary or other income on the basis of your tax card.
This is called withholding tax (ennakonpidätys).
The amount of withholding tax is based on your estimate of your income.
The amount of tax is checked afterwards on the basis of your actual income and deductions.
You will receive a tax decision together with a pre-completed tax return.
If you do not make any changes to the tax return, the tax decision will remain in effect.
If you make changes to the tax return, you will receive a new tax decision later.
Remember also to check the new tax decision.
Retain the tax decision and the specification section which you will receive in the spring with your tax return.
If you order a new specification section, it will be subject to a fee.

Tax return and tax decisionFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Deductions
Deductions (vähennys) in your taxation will reduce the amount of tax you must pay.
The Tax Administration makes some of the deductions automatically but some of them you must claim yourself.
Deductions may include the following, for example:
tax credit for domestic help or household expenses
deduction for commuting expenses, i.e. daily travel from home to work
interest on a mortgage
You can deduct the interest on your mortgage when you have taken the mortgage for your permanent home.
You can also deduct the interest on your mortgage if your permanent home is located abroad.
If you have a mortgage from a Finnish bank, the Tax Administration will receive information on the mortgage directly from the bank.
If you have a mortgage from a foreign bank, you must report the information on the mortgage to the Tax Administration yourself.
You can report any deductions when you order a new tax card.
In that case, the deductions will be taken into account in your tax percentage.
You can also claim deductions afterwards using a tax return.
In that case, you will receive the deductions in arrears as tax refunds.

Tax refund and back tax
The tax decision indicates whether the correct amount of taxes has been withheld from your salary.
If you have paid too much tax, you will receive a tax refund (veronpalautus).
If you have paid too little tax, you will have to pay back tax (jäännösvero).
A tax refund will be paid directly to your bank account.
Report your bank account number to the Tax Administration either in the online service or using a paper form.
You can receive the tax refund to a Finnish or a foreign bank account.
If you have to pay back tax, you will receive a bank transfer form along with the tax decision.
The bank transfer form contains the amount of back tax, a bank account number, a due date and a reference number.

Responsibility for the orientation of employees and for their safety
When you start business operations, you have many duties.
You must, for example, register the company, pay taxes and organise bookkeeping.
Permission or notification
In Finland it is possible to be engaged in a lawful trade that is in accordance with good practice without a permit granted by authorities.
In some cases, however, a permit is required to start a business or a declaration of starting one has to be made to authorities.
For example, if you have a beauty salon or a business that sells food products, the premises must be inspected.
Apply for a permit from the municipal health authority before starting to use the premises.
Before starting business activities, check whether a permit is required or whether authorities need to notified of the new business.
You can find out whether a permit is required for your business by contacting a Regional State Administrative Agency or by visiting the Enterprise Finland website.

A notification of starting a business has to be made to the Trade Register of the National Board of Patents and Registration in Finland (Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus).
The same form can be used to notify both the National Board of Patents and Registration in Finland and the Tax Administration of starting a business.

Insurance
Self-employed persons’ pension insurance (YEL-vakuutus) is mandatory, if the self-employed person is between the age of 18 and 68 and receives at least 7,799.37 euros (situation in 2019) of income per year from his or her business.
A retirement pension insurance secures an entrepreneur’s livelihood when business activities end due to incapacity for work or old age and provides the entrepreneur’s family with a survivors' pension after the death of the entrepreneur.
Retirement pension insurance policies can be obtained either from an insurance company or pension fund (eläkekassa).
Take out a retirement pension insurance policy at the latest when six months have passed from starting the business.
A new beginning entrepreneur receives a 22% reduction in price for the pension payments of the first four years.
The cost of insurance premiums and the amount of future pension payments depend on how much earned income (työtulo) the entrepreneur achieves.
The amount of earned income also affects the amount of various earnings-related benefits (ansiosidonnainen etuus), such as sickness allowance.
linkkiFinnish Centre for Pensions:
Information about pension insurance for a self-employed personFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Employees must be provided with a retirement pension insurance (TyEL insurance) (eläkevakuutus, TyEL-vakuutus) and accident insurance, which includes group life insurance and unemployment insurance.
An employer pays an employee’s social security contribution to the tax authorities at the same time as the employer withholds taxes from the employee’s wages.
In some lines of business, employers are obliged also to take out other compulsory insurance policies besides the ones described here.
You should also consider taking out other voluntary insurance policies, such as the accident insurance for an entrepreneur.

Bookkeeping
In Finland, every entrepreneur has a legal obligation to keep books.
If you don’t want to take care of bookkeeping yourself, you can hire an accounting firm to handle your company’s bookkeeping for you.
Many companies in Finland use the services of accounting firms.
Taxation
Company form has an effect on how a company is taxed.
It is worth taking this into account when choosing a company form.
A new entrepreneur can register with the Tax Administration’s prepayment register of taxpayers.
Registering is done by using the same notification form that is provided for founding a business (a business start-up notification) (yrityksen perustamisilmoitus).
If your company belongs in the prepayment register of taxpayers, you can invoice a customer without a withholding of tax.
Tax is levied for the income the entrepreneur or company has left, when all the expenses of business activities have been subtracted from it.
A company’s taxes are paid in advance on the basis of its estimated taxable income.
This estimation is based on the taxed income of the previous year.
With a new business, the entrepreneur must estimate the amount of taxable income and declare it to the tax authorities.

Value added tax
Value added tax (arvonlisävero) is a consumption tax which is collected for almost all goods and services in Finland.
Entrepreneurs who sell goods and services in Finland are obliged to pay value added tax.
If the income obtained from selling goods and services is less than 10,000 euros per year, value added tax does not need to be paid.
Company form has no bearing on the amount of value added tax.
However, the amount of value added tax of different products varies.
Incomes Register
The Incomes Register is a database in which employers report the salaries paid for their employees.
The information must be reported no later than five days after salary payment.
The information must be submitted to the Incomes Register electronically:

Responsibility for the orientation of employees and for their safety
As an entrepreneur you are responsible for familiarising your employees with their tasks.
An employer must familiarise the employees with the conditions of the workplace and the correct working methods.
An employer is also obliged to take care of employees’ safety and health at work.
An employer must prepare a strategy for the protection of workers (työsuojelun toimintaohjelma) which defines the risks to health and safety involved in the job and workplace, and describes how these risks can be avoided.

You need to have a tax card (verokortti) if you receive a salary or other income in Finland.
The tax card shows your tax rate (veroprosentti).
The employer will then know how much tax to withhold from your salary.
Your tax rate depends on the amount of your income.
If you have just moved to Finland, you can receive a tax card from a tax office (verotoimisto).
For the tax card, you need to estimate the amount of income you will receive during the whole year.
You also need to have a Finnish personal identity code.
You will receive a personal identity code when you register as a resident at the Local Register Office.
You can also receive a personal identity code from a tax office.
Read more on the page Registering as a resident.
When you live permanently in Finland, the Tax Administration will send you a new tax card each year in January.
The Tax Administration will calculate an appropriate tax rate for you on the basis of how much you have earned in the previous year.
Show the tax card to your employer.
If you do not show the tax card to your employer, they will deduct 60% of your salary as taxes.
If your income decreases or increases during the year, order a new tax card.

When establishing a business, the company form, the name of the company and choice of the field of activity have to be chosen.
Factors influencing the choice of company form include the number of founders, capital requirement, division of responsibility and decision-making, financing and taxation.
The various company forms in Finland are: proprietorship (toiminimi); partnership (avoin yhtiö); limited partnership (kommandiittiyhtiö); limited company (osakeyhtiö) and cooperative association (osuuskunta).
When you are considering the choice of company form, it is strongly advised that you contact an establishment offering Business advice.
linkkiThe Finnish Enterprise Agencies:
Business adviceFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Proprietorship (toiminimi)
The simplest and most popular way to start in business is to operate as a private entrepreneur using a company name.
Decision-making and responsibility in the company belong with the entrepreneur, and the company may employ workers as in other forms of business.
For part-time entrepreneurship it is often beneficial to start as a proprietorship.
Starting business in this way is speedy and uncomplicated.
Limited company is the most common company form in Finland.
A limited company is suitable for all kinds of business operations.
You can start a limited company alone or with other shareholders.
A shareholder’s voting power, profit and liability depend on how many shares they own.
A partnership is formed when two or more individuals agree to it by signing a partnership agreement.
The partners have equal status in all the company’s operations and are personally responsible for company decisions, liabilities and debts.
A limited partnership differs from an ordinary partnership in that in addition to one or more accountable partners there is at least one sleeping partner, i.e. a participant in the company who generally acts as an investor.
Cooperative association is a company owned by its members.
There can be one or several members.
Each member has one vote in cooperative association meetings.
The liability of the members for the cooperative association’s obligations (for example, debts) is limited to their investment of share capital.

Register as an unemployed job seeker
If you become unemployed, register yourself at the TE Office no later than on your first day of unemployment.
If you are covered by Finnish social security, you can apply for unemployment benefit.
You may receive unemployment benefit starting from the day you have registered as an unemployed job seeker.
Don’t forget to register immediately also after studying, labour market training or a period of subsidised employment.
Register yourself as a job seeker through the TE Office’s online service.
Log in using your online banking identifiers or an identity card with a chip.
A TE Office employee will call you if additional clarification is needed.
There is no need for you to call or visit the TE Office unless specifically requested to do so.
If you do not have online banking identifiers or an identity card with a chip, register yourself as a job seeker at your nearest TE Office.
Only the citizens of EU member states, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland can register as job seekers via the online service.
If you are a citizen of some other country, you must register as a job seeker at a TE Office.
When you go to the TE Office take along
all your testimonials of service and study certificates
a passport which shows your residence permit
The TE Office will examine the information you have provided.
The unemployment benefit is subject to certain conditions, and the TE Office will determine whether the conditions are met in your situation.
The TE Office will then issue a statement about the matter to the authority paying the benefit, i.e. the unemployment fund or Kela.
You can ask for advice on matters relating to unemployment benefit at your own TE Office.
You can also call the unemployment counselling services of the TE services:

Holidaymaking, studying or working during unemployment
If you start working or studying while you are unemployed, please notify the TE Office.
They will advise you on how this will affect your unemployment benefit.
If you travel in Finland or abroad, make sure you can be reached at all times.
Leave, for example, your phone number and address at the TE Office and tell the staff how long you plan to stay at your travel destination.
A trip abroad is not, however, an acceptable reason for turning down a job offered to you.
If you start business activities while you are unemployed, you may receive unemployment benefit for the first 4 months.
Qualifying period
You may lose your right to daily unemployment allowance for a prescribed time if your unemployment is due to a self-inflicted reason.
This can happen, for example, if:
you do not apply for a job proposed to you by the TE Office
you do not accept a job that is offered to you
you resign from you work yourself without a solid reason.
The qualifying period length varies from 15 to 90 days.
The length depends on the cause of the qualifying period.
In some cases, you may lose your right to unemployment benefit for the time being.
In Finland, you pay income tax (tulovero) on your salary.
You must also pay taxes on the following income:
payment for labour or service
business income
unemployment allowance
parental allowance
pensions
study grant
With tax money, the state and municipalities pay for the following, for example:
health care
education
day care
defence
In Finland, taxation is progressive.
This means that the tax rate (the share of taxes) is larger for a larger salary than for a smaller salary.
A withholding tax percentage (veroprosentti) is calculated separately for each person in Finland.
The spouse’s income does not affect your withholding tax percentage.
You can estimate your own tax percentage using the Tax Administration’s calculator.
The employer withholds taxes directly from your salary.
For that purpose, the employer must have your tax card.
The tax that is withheld directly from your salary is the withholding tax (ennakonpidätys).
After each year, the Tax Administration calculates whether a sufficient amount of taxes has been withheld from the income.
If you have paid too much in tax, you will receive a tax refund (veronpalautus).
If you have not paid enough in tax, you will have to pay back tax (jäännösvero).
Further information: Tax return and tax decision.
Check your salary slip and tax return (veroilmoitus) to ensure that your employer has withheld taxes from your salary.
Retain your salary slips.
If the tax has not been withheld, you will have to pay it in arrears.
In addition to taxes, your employer will withhold insurance payments from your salary for unemployment and sickness, for example.

Taxation when you come to work in Finland
If you come from abroad to work in Finland, your taxation depends on how long you will stay in Finland.
Taxation also depends on whether your employer is a Finnish or a foreign company.
If you reside in Finland for more than six months, you must usually pay taxes on your salary in Finland.
Usually, you must also pay the obligatory insurance payments in Finland.
You need a Finnish personal identity code and a tax card.
The tax rate is calculated on the basis of the income for the whole year.
You will be granted tax deductions on the same basis as everyone else who lives permanently in Finland.
If you reside in Finland for six months at the most and your employer is a foreign company, you do not usually need to pay taxes in Finland.
If your employer is Finnish or your foreign employer has an office in Finland, you will pay taxes in Finland.
You can apply for progressive taxation if you live in a country that belongs to the European Economic Area or a country with which Finland has a tax agreement.
Otherwise, you will pay 35% tax at source (lähdevero) on your salary and you must have a tax-at-source card.
You must apply for a tax-at-source card using a paper form.
For progressive taxation, you must have a non-resident’s tax card (rajoitetusti verovelvollisen verokortti).
You can obtain it from a tax office.
You can also apply for progressive taxation afterwards.
You will also have to pay insurance payments if you are not insured in the country in which you reside permanently.
If you already have an insurance cover from another country, you need to have a certificate of the insurance (A1/E101).
When you move away from Finland, remember to submit a notification of the move to the Local Register Office.
This will ensure that your tax return will be sent to the correct address.

An employer must take out an accident insurance policy (tapaturmavakuutus) for their employees.
This must be done every time an employment contract begins.
An employee may obtain compensation when an accident at work has taken place.
This compensation may occur as daily allowance for medical treatment expenses and loss of earnings, workers’ compensation pension, compensation for an injury caused by the accident, rehabilitation or, in fatal cases, survivors' pension for relatives.
In addition to statutory insurance policies, an employer may also take out various voluntary insurance policies for their employees.
It is a good idea to discuss with your employer what kinds of insurance policies they have taken out for their employees.
Testimonial of service
When an employee’s contract of employment expires they are entitled to a written testimonial of service from their employer.

Entrepreneur’s unemployment benefit
An entrepreneur is also entitled to unemployment benefit.
An entrepreneur is unemployed when they have ended their business activities or sold their share of the company.
Entrepreneurship can end in selling or dissolving the company, in bankruptcy, liquidation, or because of a divorce.
An entrepreneur is also considered unemployed if business operations have been suspended for at least four months.
If you need to close down your business, you should immediately register yourself as unemployed in the TE Office online service.
You are entitled to unemployment benefit starting from the day you registered your unemployment at the TE Office.
Information about entrepreneurs' social securityFinnish _ Swedish _ English
If you want to be entitled to earnings-related unemployment allowance, you must join the unemployment fund for entrepreneurs (yrittäjien työttömyyskassa).
If your business operations end, you may then apply for earnings-related daily allowance (ansiosidonnainen päiväraha) from the unemployment fund.
To receive earnings-related daily allowance from the unemployment fund, you must have been an entrepreneur and a member of the fund for a required time period before becoming unemployed.
Earnings-related unemployment allowance is larger than basic unemployment allowance or labour market subsidy.
Its size depends on the amount of earned income you have registered in the entrepreneur’s retirement pension insurance.

Basic unemployment allowance
Kela can pay basic unemployment allowance (peruspäiväraha) to an unemployed entrepreneur who is not a member of an unemployment fund.
You may receive basic unemployment allowance, if you meet an entrepreneur’s condition regarding previous employment and are covered by Finnish social security.
The Kela website includes a calculator that can be used to estimate if you meet an entrepreneur’s condition regarding previous employment.
Labour market subsidy
If you are not eligible to receive basic unemployment allowance, but are covered by Finnish social security you can apply for labour market subsidy.
Labour market subsidy is a means-tested benefit, meaning that any other income and your overall situation will influence the amount of labour market subsidy you receive.
Entrepreneur’s occupational health care (työterveyshuolto)
An entrepreneur and other persons working for themselves can organise occupational health care for themselves if they like.
An entrepreneur is not obliged to arrange occupational health care for themselves. However, an entrepreneur must organise occupational health care for their employees.
This can be arranged at the local health centre (terveyskeskus) or, for example, a private clinic.

When an entrepreneur falls ill
If you fall ill, Kela may pay you sickness allowance (sairauspäiväraha) which compensates for the loss of earnings due to incapacity for work if this incapacity continues for less than a year.
Payments of daily allowance begin after the qualifying period for benefit (omavastuuaika).
An entrepreneur’s qualifying period for benefit is usually the first day of illness plus the following three weekdays.

Send the completed forms by post.
Remember to check the tax return and make any necessary changes by the last return date.
Tax decision
Tax decision (verotuspäätös) is a calculation of the final amount of taxes.
Taxes have been withheld from your salary or other income on the basis of your tax card.
This is called withholding tax (ennakonpidätys).
The amount of withholding tax is based on your estimate of your income.
The amount of tax is checked afterwards on the basis of your actual income and deductions.
You will receive a tax decision together with a pre-completed tax return.
If you do not make any changes to the tax return, the tax decision will remain in effect.
If you make changes to the tax return, you will receive a new tax decision later.
Remember also to check the new tax decision.
Retain the tax decision and the specification section which you will receive in the spring with your tax return.
If you order a new specification section, it will be subject to a fee.

Tax return and tax decisionFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Deductions
Deductions (vähennys) in your taxation will reduce the amount of tax you must pay.
The Tax Administration makes some of the deductions automatically but some of them you must claim yourself.
Deductions may include the following, for example:
tax credit for domestic help or household expenses
deduction for commuting expenses, i.e. daily travel from home to work
interest on a mortgage
You can deduct the interest on your mortgage when you have taken the mortgage for your permanent home.
You can also deduct the interest on your mortgage if your permanent home is located abroad.
If you have a mortgage from a Finnish bank, the Tax Administration will receive information on the mortgage directly from the bank.
If you have a mortgage from a foreign bank, you must report the information on the mortgage to the Tax Administration yourself.
You can report any deductions when you order a new tax card.
In that case, the deductions will be taken into account in your tax percentage.
You can also claim deductions afterwards using a tax return.
In that case, you will receive the deductions in arrears as tax refunds.

Tax refund and back tax
The tax decision indicates whether the correct amount of taxes has been withheld from your salary.
If you have paid too much tax, you will receive a tax refund (veronpalautus).
If you have paid too little tax, you will have to pay back tax (jäännösvero).
A tax refund will be paid directly to your bank account.
Report your bank account number to the Tax Administration either in the online service or using a paper form.
You can receive the tax refund to a Finnish or a foreign bank account.
If you have to pay back tax, you will receive a bank transfer form along with the tax decision.

Responsibility for the orientation of employees and for their safety
When you start business operations, you have many duties.
You must, for example, register the company, pay taxes and organise bookkeeping.
Permission or notification
In Finland it is possible to be engaged in a lawful trade that is in accordance with good practice without a permit granted by authorities.
In some cases, however, a permit is required to start a business or a declaration of starting one has to be made to authorities.
For example, if you have a beauty salon or a business that sells food products, the premises must be inspected.
Apply for a permit from the municipal health authority before starting to use the premises.
Before starting business activities, check whether a permit is required or whether authorities need to notified of the new business.
You can find out whether a permit is required for your business by contacting a Regional State Administrative Agency or by visiting the Enterprise Finland website.

Insurance
Self-employed persons’ pension insurance (YEL-vakuutus) is mandatory, if the self-employed person is between the age of 18 and 68 and receives at least 7,799.37 euros (situation in 2019) of income per year from his or her business.
A retirement pension insurance secures an entrepreneur’s livelihood when business activities end due to incapacity for work or old age and provides the entrepreneur’s family with a survivors' pension after the death of the entrepreneur.
Retirement pension insurance policies can be obtained either from an insurance company or pension fund (eläkekassa).
Take out a retirement pension insurance policy at the latest when six months have passed from starting the business.
A new beginning entrepreneur receives a 22% reduction in price for the pension payments of the first four years.
The cost of insurance premiums and the amount of future pension payments depend on how much earned income (työtulo) the entrepreneur achieves.
The amount of earned income also affects the amount of various earnings-related benefits (ansiosidonnainen etuus), such as sickness allowance.

Employees must be provided with a retirement pension insurance (TyEL insurance) (eläkevakuutus, TyEL-vakuutus) and accident insurance, which includes group life insurance and unemployment insurance.
An employer pays an employee’s social security contribution to the tax authorities at the same time as the employer withholds taxes from the employee’s wages.
In some lines of business, employers are obliged also to take out other compulsory insurance policies besides the ones described here.
You should also consider taking out other voluntary insurance policies, such as the accident insurance for an entrepreneur.

In Finland, every entrepreneur has a legal obligation to keep books.
If you don’t want to take care of bookkeeping yourself, you can hire an accounting firm to handle your company’s bookkeeping for you.
Many companies in Finland use the services of accounting firms.
Taxation
Company form has an effect on how a company is taxed.
It is worth taking this into account when choosing a company form.
A new entrepreneur can register with the Tax Administration’s prepayment register of taxpayers.
Registering is done by using the same notification form that is provided for founding a business (a business start-up notification) (yrityksen perustamisilmoitus).
If your company belongs in the prepayment register of taxpayers, you can invoice a customer without a withholding of tax.
Tax is levied for the income the entrepreneur or company has left, when all the expenses of business activities have been subtracted from it.
A company’s taxes are paid in advance on the basis of its estimated taxable income.
This estimation is based on the taxed income of the previous year.
With a new business, the entrepreneur must estimate the amount of taxable income and declare it to the tax authorities.

Value added tax
Value added tax (arvonlisävero) is a consumption tax which is collected for almost all goods and services in Finland.
Entrepreneurs who sell goods and services in Finland are obliged to pay value added tax.
If the income obtained from selling goods and services is less than 10,000 euros per year, value added tax does not need to be paid.
Company form has no bearing on the amount of value added tax.
However, the amount of value added tax of different products varies.
Incomes Register
The Incomes Register is a database in which employers report the salaries paid for their employees.
The information must be reported no later than five days after salary payment.
The information must be submitted to the Incomes Register electronically:
directly through the payment system if it has a built-in technical connection to the Incomes Register, or
through the Incomes Register online service, which you can access using your online banking credentials or other means of electronic authentication.
Salary information can be reported on a paper form only in special cases.

An employer is also obliged to take care of employees’ safety and health at work.
An employer must prepare a strategy for the protection of workers (työsuojelun toimintaohjelma) which defines the risks to health and safety involved in the job and workplace, and describes how these risks can be avoided.

An employee is entitled to receive, on request, a testimonial of service from their employer at the end of the contract of employment.
A testimonial of service is an important document specifying the duration of the contract of employment and the employee’s tasks.
The employee can also ask that the reason why the contract of employment ended and an estimation of the employee’s skills and behaviour are included in the testimonial.
Even ten years after the contract of employment has ended, the employer is obliged to provide a testimonial of service and, after this, only if it does not cause the employer unreasonable inconvenience.
If the employee wishes to have an estimation of their skills and behaviour included in the testimonial, the employer shall deliver it to the employee on their request up to five years after the contract of employment has ended.
The employer shall also give the employee a new testimonial of service if the employee’s testimonial is lost or gets ruined.
An employer who knowingly or out of carelessness fails to provide a testimonial of service is in breach of the Employment Contracts Act.

Your tax rate depends on the amount of your income.
If you have just moved to Finland, you can receive a tax card from a tax office (verotoimisto).
For the tax card, you need to estimate the amount of income you will receive during the whole year.

When establishing a business, the company form, the name of the company and choice of the field of activity have to be chosen.
Factors influencing the choice of company form include the number of founders, capital requirement, division of responsibility and decision-making, financing and taxation.
The various company forms in Finland are: proprietorship (toiminimi); partnership (avoin yhtiö); limited partnership (kommandiittiyhtiö); limited company (osakeyhtiö) and cooperative association (osuuskunta).
When you are considering the choice of company form, it is strongly advised that you contact an establishment offering Business advice.
linkkiThe Finnish Enterprise Agencies:
Business adviceFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Proprietorship (toiminimi)
The simplest and most popular way to start in business is to operate as a private entrepreneur using a company name.
Decision-making and responsibility in the company belong with the entrepreneur, and the company may employ workers as in other forms of business.
For part-time entrepreneurship it is often beneficial to start as a proprietorship.
Starting business in this way is speedy and uncomplicated.
Limited company is the most common company form in Finland.
A limited company is suitable for all kinds of business operations.
You can start a limited company alone or with other shareholders.
A shareholder’s voting power, profit and liability depend on how many shares they own.
A partnership is formed when two or more individuals agree to it by signing a partnership agreement.
The partners have equal status in all the company’s operations and are personally responsible for company decisions, liabilities and debts.
A limited partnership differs from an ordinary partnership in that in addition to one or more accountable partners there is at least one sleeping partner, i.e. a participant in the company who generally acts as an investor.
Cooperative association is a company owned by its members.
There can be one or several members.
Each member has one vote in cooperative association meetings.
The liability of the members for the cooperative association’s obligations (for example, debts) is limited to their investment of share capital.

When a child is born to a family, the parents are entitled to family leave, i.e. to stay at home and look after the child.
Family leave signifies
maternity leave
paternity leave
parental leave
child care leave
Notify your employer of your family leave at least two months in advance.
Family leave is usually unpaid vacation.
Whether or not you will be paid for your family leave depends on your collective agreement.
Check the matter from your employer.
Kela pays family allowance for the time of family leave, i.e. parental allowance and home care allowance.
Read about the conditions of family allowance on the InfoFinland pages Benefits for a family after a child is born and Benefits for looking after a child at home.
When the family leave has ended, the employee has the right to return to their own work or to comparable work in their old workplace.
The contract of employment of a pregnant woman cannot be dissolved, nor can she be discriminated against because of her pregnancy.
Employers and employees in Finland are very familiar with these family leaves and they are commonly utilised.

Maternity leave
The duration of maternity leave is 105 weekdays.
Working is allowed during maternity leave if it can take place without endangering the safety of the mother, foetus or child.
However, the mother cannot work while on maternity leave during the two weeks before the expected date of delivery, nor during the two weeks after giving birth.
Paternity leave
Paternity leave is the part of parental leave intended for the father.
The length of paternity leave is 54 weekdays.
These days cannot be transferred to the mother.
You can take a maximum of 18 days of paternity leave at the same time as the mother of your child is on maternity or parental leave.
You can divide these days into up to four periods.
The remaining 36 days can be divided into up to two periods.
During these 36 days, the mother of your child cannot be on parental leave.
The intention is that the father will look after the child.
You can also take all 54 days of paternity leave at a different time than the mother.
You can decide for yourself if you want to have all paternity leave days or only some of them.
Paternity leave can only be used to take care of a child who is under 2 years of age.
When your child turns 2, you can no longer stay on paternity leave even if you have some days left.
Parental leave
After the period of maternity leave, either the mother or father can stay at home to look after the baby on parental leave which is 158 weekdays long.
Both parents cannot take parental leave at the same time.
Parental leave can, however, be divided so that the father and the mother take turns in staying home with the child.
Child care leave
After the parental leave period is over, the father or mother can take unpaid child care leave to look after their child until the child turns 3.
This requires that the mother or father has been working for the same employer for at least 6 months during the past year.
During the child care leave, Kela pays the parent home care allowance.
Read more about the conditions for home care allowance at the InfoFinland page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
Partial child care leave
Child care leave can also be part-time.
This means working shorter hours and being paid correspondingly less.
It is also possible for both parents to take partial child care leave, for example, so that one works in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
You can stay on partial child care leave until your child completes his/her second school grade.
You can apply for partial child care allowance from Kela for looking after a child who is under the age of 3 or in grade 1 or 2 of school if you have a municipality of residence in Finland.
Partial child care allowance is not granted for looking after a child who is three years old or over, but not yet in school.
Read more about partial child care allowance on the InfoFinland web page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
In Finland, you pay income tax (tulovero) on your salary.
You must also pay taxes on the following income:
unemployment allowance
parental allowance
pensions
study grant
With tax money, the state and municipalities pay for the following, for example:
health care
education
day care
defence
In Finland, taxation is progressive.
This means that the tax rate (the share of taxes) is larger for a larger salary than for a smaller salary.
A withholding tax percentage (veroprosentti) is calculated separately for each person in Finland.
The spouse’s income does not affect your withholding tax percentage.
You can estimate your own tax percentage using the Tax Administration’s calculator.
The employer withholds taxes directly from your salary.
For that purpose, the employer must have your tax card.
The tax that is withheld directly from your salary is the withholding tax (ennakonpidätys).
After each year, the Tax Administration calculates whether a sufficient amount of taxes has been withheld from the income.
If you have paid too much in tax, you will receive a tax refund (veronpalautus).
If you have not paid enough in tax, you will have to pay back tax (jäännösvero).
Further information: Tax return and tax decision.
Check your salary slip and tax return (veroilmoitus) to ensure that your employer has withheld taxes from your salary.
Retain your salary slips.
If the tax has not been withheld, you will have to pay it in arrears.
In addition to taxes, your employer will withhold insurance payments from your salary for unemployment and sickness, for example.

Taxation when you come to work in Finland
If you come from abroad to work in Finland, your taxation depends on how long you will stay in Finland.
Taxation also depends on whether your employer is a Finnish or a foreign company.
If you reside in Finland for more than six months, you must usually pay taxes on your salary in Finland.
Usually, you must also pay the obligatory insurance payments in Finland.
You need a Finnish personal identity code and a tax card.
The tax rate is calculated on the basis of the income for the whole year.
You will be granted tax deductions on the same basis as everyone else who lives permanently in Finland.
If you reside in Finland for six months at the most and your employer is a foreign company, you do not usually need to pay taxes in Finland.
If your employer is Finnish or your foreign employer has an office in Finland, you will pay taxes in Finland.
You can apply for progressive taxation if you live in a country that belongs to the European Economic Area or a country with which Finland has a tax agreement.
Otherwise, you will pay 35% tax at source (lähdevero) on your salary and you must have a tax-at-source card.
You must apply for a tax-at-source card using a paper form.
For progressive taxation, you must have a non-resident’s tax card (rajoitetusti verovelvollisen verokortti).
You can obtain it from a tax office.
You can also apply for progressive taxation afterwards.
You will also have to pay insurance payments if you are not insured in the country in which you reside permanently.
If you already have an insurance cover from another country, you need to have a certificate of the insurance (A1/E101).
When you move away from Finland, remember to submit a notification of the move to the Local Register Office.
This will ensure that your tax return will be sent to the correct address.
When you are moving to Finland, you can find more information in the section Moving to Finland.

Develop a business idea
The process of starting a business is the same as for Finnish citizens.
If you want to establish a business, consider carefully whether your business idea is a good one.
Consider too, whether you have sufficient professional skill and experience.
It is important to be very familiar with the laws governing your field of business and entrepreneurship in general.
It is also important to know your customers and sales methods.
Don’t forget that there are also risks involved in entrepreneurship.
Adequate financing and careful planning are essential.
linkkiEnterprise Finland:

Make a business plan
In a business plan, you analyse the strengths and weaknesses of your skills as well as the properties of the product, goods or service you will offer.
Consider who your customers are and what kinds of wishes they have.
Also consider who your competitors are and what kind of products and operating methods they have.
The most important part of a business plan is the operation plan of your company.
Consider carefully how, where and on what kind of premises your company will operate.
Consider the production equipment or labour you will need.
What kind of advertising media will you use to promote sales?
You must also find out whether insurance covers the operational risks.
Also consider how you will organise bookkeeping and plan finances.
How will you monitor the realisation of your plans?
Write down all these things in your business plan.

If you want to be entitled to earnings-related unemployment allowance, you must join the unemployment fund for entrepreneurs (yrittäjien työttömyyskassa).
If your business operations end, you may then apply for earnings-related daily allowance (ansiosidonnainen päiväraha) from the unemployment fund.
To receive earnings-related daily allowance from the unemployment fund, you must have been an entrepreneur and a member of the fund for a required time period before becoming unemployed.
Earnings-related unemployment allowance is larger than basic unemployment allowance or labour market subsidy.
Its size depends on the amount of earned income you have registered in the entrepreneur’s retirement pension insurance.

Basic unemployment allowance
Kela can pay basic unemployment allowance (peruspäiväraha) to an unemployed entrepreneur who is not a member of an unemployment fund.
You may receive basic unemployment allowance, if you meet an entrepreneur’s condition regarding previous employment and are covered by Finnish social security.
The Kela website includes a calculator that can be used to estimate if you meet an entrepreneur’s condition regarding previous employment.
Labour market subsidy
If you are not eligible to receive basic unemployment allowance, but are covered by Finnish social security you can apply for labour market subsidy.
Labour market subsidy is a means-tested benefit, meaning that any other income and your overall situation will influence the amount of labour market subsidy you receive.
Entrepreneur’s occupational health care (työterveyshuolto)
An entrepreneur is not obliged to arrange occupational health care for themselves.
However, an entrepreneur must organise occupational health care for their employees.
This can be arranged at the local health centre (terveyskeskus) or, for example, a private clinic.

When an entrepreneur falls ill
If you fall ill, Kela may pay you sickness allowance (sairauspäiväraha) which compensates for the loss of earnings due to incapacity for work if this incapacity continues for less than a year.
Payments of daily allowance begin after the qualifying period for benefit (omavastuuaika).
An entrepreneur’s qualifying period for benefit is usually the first day of illness plus the following three weekdays.

Everybody has a right to occupational health care
In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
An employer may also arrange for nursing services for their employees.
In occupational health care, it is possible to receive the services of a nurse, occupational doctor and occupational psychologist.
Often there are also physiotherapists.
Occupational health care does not usually include the services of specialists.
Ask your employer what is included in occupational health care at your workplace.
The right to occupational health care does not extend to the employee’s family.
The target of occupational health care is to promote health, working capacity and teamwork at workplaces.
Occupational health care staff are bound to professional secrecy.
They will not share your information with your employer unless you specifically give them permission to do so.
Occupational health care can, however, give your employer an evaluation on whether or not your health allows you to continue to work.
Kela compensates a part of the expenses of occupational health care to the employer and entrepreneur if they are necessary and reasonable.

When you go into business you have many obligations, including company registration and organising taxation and bookkeeping.
Permission or notification
In Finland it is possible to be engaged in a lawful trade that is in accordance with good practice without a permit granted by authorities.
In some cases, however, a permit is required to start a business or a declaration of starting one has to be made to authorities.
An inspection of the premises of, for example, companies selling foodstuffs, or a beauty salon, must be carried out and a licence obtained from the municipal health authorities, before such premises can be utilised.
Before starting business activities, check whether a permit is required or whether authorities need to notified of the new business.
You can find out whether a permit is required for your business by contacting a Regional State Administrative Agency or by visiting the Enterprise Finland website.

Start-up Notification
A notification of starting a business has to be made to the Trade Register of the National Board of Patents and Registration in Finland (Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus).
The same form can be used to notify both the National Board of Patents and Registration in Finland and the Tax Administration of starting a business.

Insurance
Self-employed persons’ pension insurance (YEL-vakuutus) is mandatory, if the self-employed person is between the age of 18 and 68 and receives at least 7 645.25 euros (situation in 2018) of income per year from his or her business.
A retirement pension insurance secures an entrepreneur’s livelihood when business activities end due to incapacity for work or old age and provides the entrepreneur’s family with a survivors' pension after the death of the entrepreneur.
Retirement pension insurance policies can be obtained either from an insurance company or pension fund (eläkekassa).
Take out a retirement pension insurance policy at the latest when six months have passed from starting the business.
A new beginning entrepreneur receives a 22% reduction in price for the pension payments of the first four years.
The cost of insurance premiums and the amount of future pension payments depend on how much earned income (työtulo) the entrepreneur achieves.
The insurer and the entrepreneur agree on a suitable amount of earned income when the entrepreneur takes out a pension insurance policy for a self-employed person.
The earned income must be approximately the same as the entrepreneur’s pay would be on average, if they were performing a similar job in someone else’s employment.
The amount of earned income also affects the amount of various earnings-related benefits (ansiosidonnainen etuus), such as sickness allowance.
Employees must be provided with a retirement pension insurance (TyEL insurance) (eläkevakuutus, TyEL-vakuutus) and accident insurance, which includes group life insurance and unemployment insurance.
An employer pays an employee’s social security contribution to the tax authorities at the same time as the employer withholds taxes from the employee’s wages.
In some lines of business, employers are obliged also to take out other compulsory insurance policies besides the ones described here.
You should also consider taking out other voluntary insurance policies, such as the accident insurance for an entrepreneur.

Bookkeeping
In Finland, every entrepreneur has a legal obligation to keep books.
If you don’t want to take care of bookkeeping yourself, you can hire an accounting firm to handle your company’s bookkeeping for you.
Many companies in Finland use the services of accounting firms.
Taxation
Company form has an effect on how a company is taxed.
It is worth taking this into account when choosing a company form.
A new entrepreneur can register with the Tax Administration’s prepayment register of taxpayers.
Registering is done by using the same notification form that is provided for founding a business (a business start-up notification) (yrityksen perustamisilmoitus).
If your company belongs in the prepayment register of taxpayers, you can invoice a customer without a withholding of tax.
Tax is levied for the income the entrepreneur or company has left, when all the expenses of business activities have been subtracted from it.
A company’s taxes are paid in advance on the basis of its estimated taxable income.
This estimation is based on the taxed income of the previous year.
With a new business, the entrepreneur must estimate the amount of taxable income and declare it to the tax authorities.

Value added tax
Value added tax (arvonlisävero) is a consumption tax which is collected for almost all goods and services in Finland.
Entrepreneurs who sell goods and services in Finland are obliged to pay value added tax.
If the income obtained from selling goods and services is less than 10,000 euros per year, value added tax does not need to be paid.
Company form has no bearing on the amount of value added tax.
However, the amount of value added tax of different products varies.
Taxation of proprietorship
Proprietorship is the most common company form in which business activities are carried on without a separately founded company.
The holder of proprietorship is taxed in such a way that all the income that remains after subtracting business expenses is taxable income.
Therefore there is no separate salary payment for the entrepreneur.
Income is taxed according to the wealth existing in the business as income from capital (pääomatulo) or earned income (ansiotulo).
Income from capital is always taxed by the same tax rate.
Earned income is taxed progressively; in other words, the greater the income, the more tax is paid on it.
Incomes Register
The Incomes Register is a database in which employers report the salaries paid for their employees.
The information must be reported no later than five days after salary payment.
The information must be submitted to the Incomes Register electronically:
directly through the payment system if it has a built-in technical connection to the Incomes Register, or
through the Incomes Register online service, which you can access using your online banking credentials or other means of electronic authentication.
Salary information can be reported on a paper form only in special cases.

Responsibility for the orientation of employees and for their safety
As an entrepreneur you are responsible for familiarising your employees with their tasks.
An employer must familiarise the employees with the conditions of the workplace and the correct working methods.
An employer is also obliged to take care of employees’ safety and health at work.
An employer must prepare a strategy for the protection of workers (työsuojelun toimintaohjelma) which defines the risks to health and safety involved in the job and workplace, and describes how these risks can be avoided.

An employee is entitled to receive, on request, a testimonial of service from their employer at the end of the contract of employment.
A testimonial of service is an important document specifying the duration of the contract of employment and the employee’s tasks.
The employee can also ask that the reason why the contract of employment ended and an estimation of the employee’s skills and behaviour are included in the testimonial.
Even ten years after the contract of employment has ended, the employer is obliged to provide a testimonial of service and, after this, only if it does not cause the employer unreasonable inconvenience.
If the employee wishes to have an estimation of their skills and behaviour included in the testimonial, the employer shall deliver it to the employee on their request up to five years after the contract of employment has ended.
The employer shall also give the employee a new testimonial of service if the employee’s testimonial is lost or gets ruined.
An employer who knowingly or out of carelessness fails to provide a testimonial of service is in breach of the Employment Contracts Act.

Health and safety activities at the workplace
A lot of attention is paid to safety at work in Finland.
Employers are responsible for everyone’s safety while they work.
An employer must organise induction to the workplace for a new employee.
An employer is also obliged to familiarise employees with the safety instructions of a workplace and to teach them correct work methods.
Employees must also look after safety at work themselves.
The work must be performed according to instructions.
If the work is clearly dangerous, an employee can refuse to do it.
Workplaces must have a sufficient number of persons with first aid skills and first aid equipment and instructions must be provided on how to act in emergency situations.
Employers organise first aid training for their staff at work.
If a workplace has at least ten employees, the employees elect a safety officer to represent them.
The safety officer familiarises themselves with the work safety issues that are relevant for the workplace, participates in workplace safety inspections and informs employees of matters relating to work safety and health.
For each workplace, the employer nominates a workplace safety manager who assists the employer in cooperation with the employees and health and safety authorities.
Health and safety authorities
Under the Regional State Administrative Agencies there are five occupational health and safety divisions.
These monitor that work safety instructions are observed at workplaces in accordance with the law.
The health and safety divisions provide guidance for both employees and employers on work safety and health, as well as in matters related to the conditions of the contract of employment.
Work safety inspectors conduct inspections at workplaces.
Among other things, they inspect whether safety regulations are being observed at the workplace, whether sufficient induction to the work has been carried out and whether foreign workers’ working conditions and conditions of employment comply with Finnish laws and agreements.
A work safety inspector is entitled to access every workplace and to see the documents that are necessary for work safety surveillance.
A health and safety authority may oblige an employer to fix any deficiencies discovered in work safety at the workplace.

You can take a maximum of 18 days of paternity leave at the same time as the mother of your child is on maternity or parental leave.
You can divide these days into up to four periods.
The remaining 36 days can be divided into up to two periods.
During these 36 days, the mother of your child cannot be on parental leave.
The intention is that the father will look after the child.
You can also take all 54 days of paternity leave at a different time than the mother.
You can decide for yourself if you want to have all paternity leave days or only some of them.
Paternity leave can only be used to take care of a child who is under 2 years of age.
When your child turns 2, you can no longer stay on paternity leave even if you have some days left.
Parental leave
After the period of maternity leave, either the mother or father can stay at home to look after the baby on parental leave which is 158 weekdays long.
Both parents cannot take parental leave at the same time.
Parental leave can, however, be divided so that the father and the mother take turns in staying home with the child.
Child care leave
After the parental leave period is over, the father or mother can take unpaid child care leave to look after their child until the child turns 3.
This requires that the mother or father has been working for the same employer for at least 6 months during the past year.
During the child care leave, Kela pays the parent home care allowance.
Read more about the conditions for home care allowance at the InfoFinland page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
Partial child care leave
Child care leave can also be part-time.
This means working shorter hours and being paid correspondingly less.
It is also possible for both parents to take partial child care leave, for example, so that one works in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
You can stay on partial child care leave until your child completes his/her second school grade.
You can apply for partial child care allowance from Kela for looking after a child who is under the age of 3 or in grade 1 or 2 of school if you have a municipality of residence in Finland.
Partial child care allowance is not granted for looking after a child who is three years old or over, but not yet in school.
Read more about partial child care allowance on the InfoFinland web page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
General information about trade unions
Finnish legislation secures an employee’s right to be a member of a trade union (ammattiliitto).
This right cannot be restricted by any agreements.
Discrimination of employees due to their membership in a trade organisation is a punishable offence.
Most Finns are members of some trade union.
Trade unions strive to secure their members’ benefits and rights, work to improve wages and job security and to develop the quality of working life.
Employees’ associations have unionised under three employees’ central organisations.
These are SAK, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions; STTK, the Finnish Confederation of Professionals and Akava, the Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland.

Joining a trade union and the membership fee
You can join a trade union in your own sector, if you like.
You can join one by contacting a shop steward at your workplace or contacting a trade union directly.
Most trade unions can be joined also by filling in an application form on the union’s website.
The members of a trade union pay the union a membership fee which is usually about 1-2% of their pay.
You can deduct the membership fee from your taxes.
The members of a trade union can participate in training and leisure activities organised by the union.
They also receive support from the union’s shop steward in conflict situations at work.
When needed, the union also provides advice and help in negotiations.
Unemployment fund
In Finland, we have a voluntary unemployment fund system.
An employee who is a member of an unemployment fund pays a membership fee to the unemployment fund while working.
If the work finishes and they become unemployed, they can apply to the unemployment fund for earnings-related daily unemployment allowance.
It pays to join an unemployment fund because the earnings-related daily allowance is greater than ordinary unemployment benefit.
When you join a trade union you can join the union’s unemployment fund.
However, the trade union and unemployment fund are separate systems.
There are also some unemployment funds which you can join without being a member of any trade union.
There are some conditions which have to be met before it is possible to receive an earnings-related daily allowance.
For example, in order to receive it, you have to be a member for a certain time before becoming unemployed.
Find out about these conditions immediately when you join an unemployment fund.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Unemployment benefit.

Representative of a trade union at the workplace
At workplaces, a trade union and its member workers are represented by a shop steward.
The shop steward is elected by the workers.
The shop steward acts as a negotiator, arbitrator and means of communication between the employer and employees.
You can also ask a shop steward, for example, about issues related to the collective agreement.
When establishing a business, the company form, the name of the company and choice of the field of activity have to be chosen.
Factors influencing the choice of company form include the number of founders, capital requirement, division of responsibility and decision-making, financing and taxation.
The various company forms in Finland are: proprietorship (toiminimi); partnership (avoin yhtiö); limited partnership (kommandiittiyhtiö); limited company (osakeyhtiö) and cooperative association (osuuskunta).
When you are considering the choice of company form, it is strongly advised that you contact an establishment offering Business advice.
Proprietorship (toiminimi)
The simplest and most popular way to start in business is to operate as a private entrepreneur using a company name.
Decision-making and responsibility in the company belong with the entrepreneur, and the company may employ workers as in other forms of business.
For part-time entrepreneurship it is often beneficial to start as a proprietorship.
Starting business in this way is speedy and uncomplicated.
Establishment of a limited company requires at least one individual or corporation, and its minimum share capital is 2,500 euros.
A shareholder’s voting power, profit and liability depend on how many shares they own.
A partnership is formed when two or more individuals agree to it by signing a partnership agreement.
The partners have equal status in all the company’s operations and are personally responsible for company decisions, liabilities and debts.
A limited partnership differs from an ordinary partnership in that in addition to one or more accountable partners there is at least one sleeping partner, i.e. a participant in the company who generally acts as an investor.
Cooperative association is a company owned by its members.
There can be one or several members.
Each member has one vote in cooperative association meetings.
The liability of the members for the cooperative association’s obligations (for example, debts) is limited to their investment of share capital.

If you fall ill or have an accident, you have the right to stay home from work.
Your employer is responsible for paying you salary during your sick leave.
If your employment has continued for more than a month before you fall ill, you will receive full salary for at least the day you fell ill and for nine days after the day you fell ill.
If you are unable to return to work after these ten days, you can apply for sickness allowance (sairauspäiväraha) from Kela, if you are covered by the Finnish social security.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Finnish social security.
Your employment contract may also list other conditions and you will be paid salary for a longer period of time.
Your employer is entitled to ask you to provide a doctor’s certificate about your illness.
If you fall ill and cannot come to work, notify your supervisor of this immediately.
Your supervisor will tell you whether you need to get a doctor’s certificate immediately or only on the fourth day of your sick leave.
Sick leave is not a vacation.
It is granted so that your body can heal, so during sick leave you cannot endanger the healing process through your own activities.

A contract of employment is made in two identical copies, one for the employee and the other for the employer.
At least the following matters are generally recorded in the contract of employment:
The parties to the contract of employment
Both the employer and employee sign the contract of employment.
The date of commencement of work
Whether the contract is valid for the present or fixed-term
A contract of employment that is valid for the present is the principal rule.
It means that work will continue until the employee resigns or the employer dismisses the employee.
An employer must have a justified reason for dismissing an employee.
Acceptable reasons for dismissal are specified in the Employment Contracts Act.
If a contract of employment is valid for the present it means that the employee has a steady or permanent job.
A fixed-term work contract means that the time of commencement and ending of work have been agreed upon.
A contract of employment can be made for a fixed-term if there are justifiable grounds for it.
Acts and collective agreements determine exactly when fixed-term contracts of employment can be used.
A contract of employment may be fixed-term, for example, for the following reasons:
deputyship
work experience placement
project work
peak demand or period
If a contract of employment is fixed-term, it is binding on both parties for the agreed term unless the possibility of dismissal has been agreed upon.
A fixed-term contract can be dissolved only for very weighty reasons.
Probationary period and its duration
A probationary period can be agreed upon at the beginning of the contract of employment.
The probationary period cannot exceed six months.
In fixed-term employment, the probationary period cannot exceed half of the employment contract duration.
During this period, the employee can assess whether the work is suitable for them, and the employer can assess whether the employee is suitable for the task.
During the probationary period, the employee and the employer can dissolve the contract of employment without a period of notice.
The grounds for dissolving the contract of employment during the probationary period must not be discriminating.
During the probationary period, the employee is paid normal remuneration.
Place of work
Duties
Remuneration and its method of payment
Remuneration is determined according to the collective agreement.
If there is no collective agreement in the sector of work, employees are entitled to reasonable remuneration.
An employer must not pay remuneration that is less than stipulated in the collective agreement.
Remuneration can contain various bonuses.
Typical bonuses to remuneration in Finland include experience bonus, overtime pay and extra compensation for shift work.
Payday is usually once or twice a month.
Employers pay remuneration to the employee’s bank account.
Employees are entitled to receive a payslip that shows the different parts which form the remuneration.
When remuneration is discussed in Finland, what is usually meant is gross salary (bruttopalkka) from which tax, employee and employer’s contributions are deducted.
The amount that remains for the employee is net salary (nettopalkka).
Working hours
The contract must specify regular working hours.
Working hours must comply with the Working Hours Act and the collective agreement.
Annual holidays and holiday pay
An employee is entitled to the same remuneration for the holiday period as when working.
In addition, an employee is paid holiday pay.
The payment of holiday pay is based on the collective agreement.
When the contract of employment expires the employee is entitled to holiday compensation for those days for which they have not received holiday or holiday compensation by the end of the contract of employment.
Period of notice
A contract of employment that is valid for the present expires after either the employee’s or employer’s period of notice.
The period of notice signifies the time for the duration of which an employee is obliged to work before the work ends.
During the period of notice, all the normal employees’ rights and obligations apply to the employee and they receive normal remuneration.
If an employer dismisses an employee, they must provide the reason for it.
The Employment Contracts Act specifies acceptable reasons for dismissal.

Plan carefully
Financing of the company must be carefully planned before the company is founded.
It is important that there is sufficient capital at the outset.
Company financing may also be partly in the form of donations or loans, for which a sound business plan will be required.
Loans
Loans granted by a bank or Finnvera are a common source of financing for a new entrepreneur.
Finnvera is a specialised financing company owned by the State of Finland.
It provides loans and guarantees to beginning or already operating businesses.
Businesses that have the prerequisite to maintain profitable operations, but do not have the down payment or collateral required by banks may be granted a loan or a security by Finnvera.
Enterprise Finland gives information on different financing options.
Also find out from the TE Office whether or not you are eligible to receive a grant for establishing a business.

Start-up grant (starttiraha)
When you become an entrepreneur, you may be given a start-up grant to ensure your livelihood during the beginning of your business operation.
Start-up grant is allocated by your local Employment and Economic Office.
It can be granted for a maximum period of 12 months.
When applying for a start-up grant, the Employment and Economic Office will determine if entrepreneurship is a suitable employment alternative for you.
You are eligible for the grant if:
you are registered as unemployed
you are not unemployed but about to transition into full-time entrepreneurship after having a job, studying or working from home.
Prerequisites for getting a start-up grant:
full-time entrepreneurship
knowledge, skillset and resources required for the planned entrepreneurship
possibility for running a profitable business, as evaluated by the Employment and Economic Development Office
start-up grant is needed for the entrepreneur to make a living
business operations will be started only after the decision on your start-up grant has been made
If you are going to apply for a start-up grant, contact your Employment and Economic Development office as soon as possible.
Other forms of support for an entrepreneur are also available.

Everybody has a right to occupational health care
In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
An employer may also arrange for nursing services for their employees.
In occupational health care, it is possible to receive the services of a nurse, occupational doctor and occupational psychologist.
Often there are also physiotherapists.
Occupational health care does not usually include the services of specialists.
Ask your employer what is included in occupational health care at your workplace.
The right to occupational health care does not extend to the employee’s family.
The target of occupational health care is to promote health, working capacity and teamwork at workplaces.
Occupational health care staff are bound to professional secrecy.
They will not share your information with your employer unless you specifically give them permission to do so.
Occupational health care can, however, give your employer an evaluation on whether or not your health allows you to continue to work.
Kela compensates a part of the expenses of occupational health care to the employer and entrepreneur if they are necessary and reasonable.

Sickness allowanceFinnish _ Swedish _ English
In Finland, an employee’s rights are determined according to labour legislation and collective agreements (työehtosopimus).
These specify, for example, minimum wages, working hours, holidays, sick pay and the conditions of terminating a contract of employment.
Employers’ associations and employees’ associations work together to agree on the working conditions in a certain field.
This leads to the creation of collective agreements (TES).
In the public sector (with the state or a municipality as an employer) a collective bargaining contract on civil servant salaries (VES) or a general municipal collective bargaining contract (KVTES) is agreed upon.
The agreed upon benefits in a collective agreement are always minimum benefits.
They cannot be less in the contract of employment.
For example, remuneration cannot be smaller than that which has been agreed upon in the collective agreement.
However, an employer and employee can agree on better conditions in the contract of employment than those stipulated in the collective agreement.
Collective agreements are concluded for a fixed period of time, usually for a year or two or even longer.
A collective agreement and a collective bargaining contract on civil servant salaries are binding to the employees’ and employers’ associations and their members.
A collective agreement can also be generally binding.
In such a case, also employers who are not members of an employers’ association have to comply with the agreement and apply it to their employees.
Job advertisements and contracts of employment may read: “palkkaus TES:in mukainen” (“remuneration according to collective agreement”).
It makes sense to find out the size of remuneration within your own field in Finland.
It is important to know the collective agreement because in Finland there is no act on minimum wage, for example; instead, minimum wages are always determined according to the collective agreement.

Labour legislationFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Contract of employment
An employer usually makes a written contract of employment with a new employee.
The contract of employment states the employee’s tasks and remuneration and other benefits and conditions related to work.
This contract can also be verbal.
If no written contract of employment has been made, the employer shall, without a specific request, provide a written account of the central conditions of work.
It is advisable to make a written contract of employment.
When matters have been written down, both employee and employer can check the contract for what has been jointly agreed upon.
This will help in cases of conflict at work.
Read more about making a contract of employment on the InfoFinland web page Contents of a contract of employment.
linkkiOccupational Safety and Health Administration:
Making a contract of employmentFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Written agreement on the central conditions of work
An employer shall give an employee a written account of the central conditions of work in employment contracts that are valid for the present and in employment contracts whose duration is longer than a month.
The written account must provide at least
the employer’s and employee’s place of residence or place of business
the work commencement time
the duration of a fixed-term work contract and the reason for its fixed-term nature
probationary period
place of work
employee’s tasks
the collective agreement applicable to the work
the basis for remuneration and other compensation and the pay period
regular working hours
the way annual holiday is determined
period of notice or the basis for its determination
If an employer does not deliver an account of the central conditions for work to the employee, they may be ordered to pay a fine.
The core of the business plan is the enterprise’s operating plan, in which careful thought is given as to how the business will operate, the type of company premises and where they will be situated, what production tools or workforce will be required, and what use will be made of advertising media and promotional activities.
It must also be clarified whether insurance covers the operational risks.
The business plan must also include the organisation of bookkeeping and economic planning, and monitoring of planning implementation.
Help in making a business plan
More detailed advice on producing a business plan can be obtained from the various business advice centres.
Guides for entrepreneurs can be downloaded from their web pages in at least Finnish and English, plus various example documents and a model business plan.
Health and safety activities at the workplace
A lot of attention is paid to safety at work in Finland.
Employers are responsible for everyone’s safety while they work.
An employer must organise induction to the workplace for a new employee.
An employer is also obliged to familiarise employees with the safety instructions of a workplace and to teach them correct work methods.
Employees must also look after safety at work themselves.
The work must be performed according to instructions.
If the work is clearly dangerous, an employee can refuse to do it.
Workplaces must have a sufficient number of persons with first aid skills and first aid equipment and instructions must be provided on how to act in emergency situations.
Employers organise first aid training for their staff at work.
If a workplace has at least ten employees, the employees elect a safety officer to represent them.
The safety officer familiarises themselves with the work safety issues that are relevant for the workplace, participates in workplace safety inspections and informs employees of matters relating to work safety and health.
For each workplace, the employer nominates a workplace safety manager who assists the employer in cooperation with the employees and health and safety authorities.
Health and safety authorities
Under the Regional State Administrative Agencies there are five occupational health and safety divisions.
These monitor that work safety instructions are observed at workplaces in accordance with the law.
The health and safety divisions provide guidance for both employees and employers on work safety and health, as well as in matters related to the conditions of the contract of employment.
Work safety inspectors conduct inspections at workplaces.
Among other things, they inspect whether safety regulations are being observed at the workplace, whether sufficient induction to the work has been carried out and whether foreign workers’ working conditions and conditions of employment comply with Finnish laws and agreements.
A work safety inspector is entitled to access every workplace and to see the documents that are necessary for work safety surveillance.
A health and safety authority may oblige an employer to fix any deficiencies discovered in work safety at the workplace.

Equality has been written into the Finnish law
Equal treatment of all people is guaranteed by Finland’s constitution.
Equality (yhdenvertaisuus) means that all people are equal regardless of their sex, age, ethnic or national origin, nationality, language, religion or beliefs, opinion, disability, health, sexual orientation or any other circumstance connected to the person.
Issues on equality in working life are enacted in the Equality Act and Employment Contracts Act.
They state that employees must be treated equally as regards employment, working conditions, conditions of employment, staff training and career advancement.

Non-Discrimination ActFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Equality in recruitment
The Equality Act (yhdenvertaisuuslaki) provides that job seekers are treated equally.
An employer shall choose the most distinguished applicant for the task.
The employer must also be able to prove that the choice is justified on acceptable grounds related to the nature of the work and that the choice was not made on discriminatory bases.
Qualities that are not necessary for the performance of the tasks must not be required of job seekers.
Equality in the workplace
An employer shall not discriminate against employees when making decisions about the distribution of tasks, offering advancement opportunities or terminating a contract of employment.
Discrimination at work is a crime.
If you suspect that you have been the object of discrimination at work, you can contact the occupational safety and health authorities or your own trade union.
In problem situations, you can ask a safety officer or shop steward for advice.

According to Finnish law, men and women are equal.
Men and women must be treated equally in employment, working conditions and remuneration.
An employee must not be set in an unequal position in working life due to pregnancy or parenthood.
The Finnish Act on Equality between Women and Men stipulates that an employer shall supervise that sexual equality is realised and that nobody is discriminated against at the workplace.
An Equality Ombudsman monitors that the Act on Equality between Women and Men is observed.
If you suspect that your employer has discriminated against you because of your sex, you can ask an Equality Ombudsman for advice and guidance and help in solving the issue.

Preparing for entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship requires professional expertise, training, knowledge of one’s own line of business and local business legislation and experience of customers and sales channels.
Don’t forget that there are also risks involved in entrepreneurship.
Adequate finance and careful planning are essential.
In entrepreneurship it is most important to be as well prepared as possible as regards knowledge and skill, since starting a business with insufficient expertise and language ability is extremely risky.
If you want to establish a business, consider carefully whether your business idea is a good one.
Consider too, whether you have sufficient professional skill and experience, and how you will arrange the financing.
In matters relating to starting a business, you can ask for help and guidance from New Enterprise Centres.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Business Advice.
Remember too, that a signature makes an agreement binding, so read all documents carefully before putting your name to any contracts.

A contract of employment is made in two identical copies, one for the employee and the other for the employer.
At least the following matters are generally recorded in the contract of employment:
The parties to the contract of employment
Both the employer and employee sign the contract of employment.
The date of commencement of work
Whether the contract is valid for the present or fixed-term
A contract of employment that is valid for the present is the principal rule.
It means that work will continue until the employee resigns or the employer dismisses the employee.
An employer must have a justified reason for dismissing an employee.
Acceptable reasons for dismissal are specified in the Employment Contracts Act.
If a contract of employment is valid for the present it means that the employee has a steady or permanent job.
A fixed-term work contract means that the time of commencement and ending of work have been agreed upon.
A contract of employment can be made for a fixed-term if there are justifiable grounds for it.
Acts and collective agreements determine exactly when fixed-term contracts of employment can be used.
A contract of employment may be fixed-term, for example, for the following reasons:
deputyship
work experience placement
project work
peak demand or period
If a contract of employment is fixed-term, it is binding on both parties for the agreed term unless the possibility of dismissal has been agreed upon.
A fixed-term contract can be dissolved only for very weighty reasons.
Probationary period and its duration
A probationary period can be agreed upon at the beginning of the contract of employment.
The probationary period cannot exceed six months.
In fixed-term employment, the probationary period cannot exceed half of the employment contract duration.
During this period, the employee can assess whether the work is suitable for them, and the employer can assess whether the employee is suitable for the task.
During the probationary period, the employee and the employer can dissolve the contract of employment without a period of notice.
The grounds for dissolving the contract of employment during the probationary period must not be discriminating.
During the probationary period, the employee is paid normal remuneration.
Place of work
Duties
Remuneration and its method of payment
Remuneration is determined according to the collective agreement.
If there is no collective agreement in the sector of work, employees are entitled to reasonable remuneration.
An employer must not pay remuneration that is less than stipulated in the collective agreement.
Remuneration can contain various bonuses.
Typical bonuses to remuneration in Finland include experience bonus, overtime pay and extra compensation for shift work.
Payday is usually once or twice a month.
Employers pay remuneration to the employee’s bank account.
Employees are entitled to receive a payslip that shows the different parts which form the remuneration.
When remuneration is discussed in Finland, what is usually meant is gross salary (bruttopalkka) from which tax, employee and employer’s contributions are deducted.
The amount that remains for the employee is net salary (nettopalkka).
Working hours
The contract must specify regular working hours.
Working hours must comply with the Working Hours Act and the collective agreement.
Annual holidays and holiday pay
An employee is entitled to the same remuneration for the holiday period as when working.
In addition, an employee is paid holiday pay.
The payment of holiday pay is based on the collective agreement.
When the contract of employment expires the employee is entitled to holiday compensation for those days for which they have not received holiday or holiday compensation by the end of the contract of employment.
Period of notice
A contract of employment that is valid for the present expires after either the employee’s or employer’s period of notice.
The period of notice signifies the time for the duration of which an employee is obliged to work before the work ends.
During the period of notice, all the normal employees’ rights and obligations apply to the employee and they receive normal remuneration.
If an employer dismisses an employee, they must provide the reason for it.
The Employment Contracts Act specifies acceptable reasons for dismissal.

If you have completed a degree in another country, you may need a decision of recognition of the degree to be able to work or study in Finland.
In most situations, the employer, educational institute or university assesses the qualifications and competence that your foreign diploma or degree has provided.
You need a recognition decision from the Finnish National Agency for Education or another authority if you want to work in a regulated profession or a position that requires a higher education degree at a specific level.

If you want to continue studies in Finland
Universities and educational institutes decide on student admission.
They also decide whether foreign studies and your other competence can be accepted as a part of the degree you complete in Finland.
If you have completed higher education courses abroad and want to continue your studies in Finland, you can get information and guidance from the student services and SIMHE services of higher education institutes.
Institutes of higher education offering SIMHE servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Jobs that do not require specific training
Not all jobs require specific training or degree level according to Finnish law.
For example, a private sector employer usually assesses independently whether a foreign diploma or degree provides sufficient qualifications for the job.
Comparability of higher education degree levels
Public sector (municipal or state) positions usually require a higher education degree at a specific level, such as a master’s degree.
If you have completed a higher education degree abroad, you can apply to the Finnish National Agency for Education for a decision to recognise your degree as comparable to a certain level.
The decision is subject to a charge.
Once your degree level has been recognised as comparable to a Finnish higher education degree, you can apply for jobs that require that level of higher education.

Regulated professions
Some professions are regulated in Finland.
This means that the education and training required for them is specified in law.
Such jobs include, for example, physiotherapist, doctor, dentist, pharmacist, nurse, attorney, auditor, class teacher and chimney sweeper.
The authorities for each sector make decisions on the right to carry out a regulated profession or use the professional title.
For example, in the social and health care sector, the decision is made by Valvira National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, and in the education sector, it is made by the Finnish National Agency for Education.
The decision is subject to a charge.
The website of the Finnish National Agency for Education has a list of regulated professions and the decision-making authorities.

Regulated professions and a degree from another EU country
If
you are a citizen of an EU member state, EEA member state or Switzerland, and
you have qualified in another EU country, EEA country or Switzerland for a profession that is regulated in Finland,
you can apply for the recognition of professional qualifications from the authority responsible for the sector.
If your education and training is very different from the education and training required in Finland, you may have to complete an adjustment period or qualification test.

Vocational degree abroad
If you have completed a vocational degree abroad, you can apply to the Finnish National Agency for Education for a statement on your degree.
The statement describes the level and contents of the degree and the positions that the degree qualifies you for in the country where you completed it.
However, the statement does not qualify you to act in a regulated profession in Finland.

Translation of documents
If the original language of your certificate is not Finnish, Swedish or English, you usually need an authorised translation of the documents done by an authorised translator.
Some authorities also accept documents in some other European languages.
Read the application instructions of the authority responsible for the sector carefully.
Where can I get help for problems in working life?
Discuss with your supervisor first.
If that does not help, contact the shop steward of the workplace.
If there is no shop steward at the workplace and you are a member of a trade union, contact your trade union.

My employment ends soon.
How does it affect my residence permit?
The situation depends on what kind of residence permit you have.

You must have a new workplace in order to apply for a new residence permit for an employee.
You can also apply for a residence permit on some other grounds.

I have been underpaid.
What should I do?
Always check your payslip to ensure that you have received the right amount of salary.
If you have received too little, ask the employer for a correction of salary payment.
If the employer does not pay the correct amount, ask for advice at occupational safety and health at the Regional State Administrative Agencies or at your own trade union.
If you cannot agree on salary payment with your employer, the matter must be resolved at court.
However, that is the final option.

My employer only wants to pay my salary in cash.
Is that allowed?
Your employer should pay your salary to your bank account.
The salary may only be paid in cash when there are no other options available.
This can be done, for example, if you do not have a bank account.
If your salary is paid in cash, you must give your employer a signed certificate of salary payment.
This way, it can be proven that that the salary has really been paid to you.
My fixed-term employment ended but I was not paid my last salary.
What should I do?
Ask the employer for the reason for the delay in payment.
Demand that the employer pay your salary.
Present the demand in writing.
If you are a trade union member, you can ask for help at your union.
If you are not a trade union member, contact the occupational safety and health authorities, for example.
I ended my job at my previous workplace but did not receive a testimonial of service.
How do I get the testimonial of service?
The employer does not have to give you a testimonial of service on its own initiative.
If you want a testimonial of service, ask for it.
The testimonial must be submitted to you as soon as possible.
If you have asked for a testimonial of service but have not received it, contact the occupational safety and health authorities.

I feel that I am treated inappropriately at my workplace.
What can I do?
All employees must be treated equally.
According to the law, no one must be discriminated against because of these reasons, for example:
form of employment

health
religious beliefs
sexual orientation

In addition to discrimination, other inappropriate treatment may also occur at workplaces, such as bullying or sexual harassment.
If he or she cannot help you, contact the occupational safety officer or shop steward at your workplace.
If the issue cannot be resolved at the workplace, contact the occupational safety and health authorities or your trade union.

In Finland, an employee’s rights are determined according to labour legislation and collective agreements (työehtosopimus).
These specify, for example, minimum wages, working hours, holidays, sick pay and the conditions of terminating a contract of employment.
Employers’ associations and employees’ associations work together to agree on the working conditions in a certain field.
This leads to the creation of collective agreements (TES).
In the public sector (with the state or a municipality as an employer) a collective bargaining contract on civil servant salaries (VES) or a general municipal collective bargaining contract (KVTES) is agreed upon.
The agreed upon benefits in a collective agreement are always minimum benefits.
They cannot be less in the contract of employment.
For example, remuneration cannot be smaller than that which has been agreed upon in the collective agreement.
However, an employer and employee can agree on better conditions in the contract of employment than those stipulated in the collective agreement.
Collective agreements are concluded for a fixed period of time, usually for a year or two or even longer.
A collective agreement and a collective bargaining contract on civil servant salaries are binding to the employees’ and employers’ associations and their members.
A collective agreement can also be generally binding.
In such a case, also employers who are not members of an employers’ association have to comply with the agreement and apply it to their employees.
Job advertisements and contracts of employment may read: “palkkaus TES:in mukainen” (“remuneration according to collective agreement”).
It makes sense to find out the size of remuneration within your own field in Finland.
It is important to know the collective agreement because in Finland there is no act on minimum wage, for example; instead, minimum wages are always determined according to the collective agreement.

Labour legislationFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Contract of employment
An employer usually makes a written contract of employment with a new employee.
The contract of employment states the employee’s tasks and remuneration and other benefits and conditions related to work.
This contract can also be verbal.
If no written contract of employment has been made, the employer shall, without a specific request, provide a written account of the central conditions of work.
It is advisable to make a written contract of employment.
When matters have been written down, both employee and employer can check the contract for what has been jointly agreed upon.
This will help in cases of conflict at work.
Read more about making a contract of employment on the InfoFinland web page Contents of a contract of employment.
linkkiOccupational Safety and Health Administration:
Making a contract of employmentFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Written agreement on the central conditions of work
An employer shall give an employee a written account of the central conditions of work in employment contracts that are valid for the present and in employment contracts whose duration is longer than a month.
The written account must provide at least
the employer’s and employee’s place of residence or place of business
the work commencement time
the duration of a fixed-term work contract and the reason for its fixed-term nature
probationary period
place of work
employee’s tasks
the collective agreement applicable to the work
the basis for remuneration and other compensation and the pay period
regular working hours
the way annual holiday is determined
period of notice or the basis for its determination
If an employer does not deliver an account of the central conditions for work to the employee, they may be ordered to pay a fine.
Read job advertisements carefully
Before you write a job application, read the job advertisement carefully and think about the kinds of skills and competence the employer is looking for.
Think of how your competence corresponds to the employer’s wishes and requirements.
You can also contact the employer and ask for more information if you have a question that the advertisement does not answer.
Call the employer only when you want to ask something concrete about the job.
Job application
Usually when you apply for a job, you send a job application and a CV (curriculum vitae) to the employer.
Sometimes the job application can be a video, a portfolio or, for example, a web page.
Write the application and CV in the same language that was used in the job advertisement.
Write a new application and update your CV every time you apply for a new job.
You can type the application into an email message or add it as an email attachment with the CV.
Always add attachments in the PDF format.
You can often send the application and CV through the employer’s website.
The purpose of a job application is to arouse the employer’s interest so that they will invite you to an interview.
The application is a reply to the job advertisement.
Respond to the wishes and requirements that were mentioned in the job advertisement.
Emphasise the things that are important for the task.
Give concrete examples of your competence.
Assure the employer that you are suitable for the task.
A job application is usually a little under one page long.
Ask someone to read and check your application.
Desired salary
You often have to add a desired salary to applications.
It is often difficult to estimate the correct amount.
The desired salary must not be too high but not too low either.
Trade unions may provide more information on the wage levels in different fields.
Compare salaries Finnish _ English
Go over your education and work experience and think about what skills they have taught you.
What are your strengths?
Also think about what skills you have from hobbies or other experiences.
Are your certificates up to date?
Keep certificates from your previous workplaces and studies.
Always remember to ask for a certificate when you have been working, training or studying.
Even ten years after the contract of employment has ended, the employer is obliged to provide a testimonial of service.
There is usually no need to send testimonials of service to the employer in advance, but it is good idea to take them to the job interview in case the employer wants to see them.
It would be good if all your references and certificates obtained abroad were translated into Finnish or Swedish.
More information is available on the InfoFinland web page Testimonial of service.
Recognition of foreign diplomas and degrees
Job hunting is easier if you know how a degree or diploma gained abroad corresponds to a Finnish one.
You can apply to the Finnish National Agency for Education for recognition of your diploma or degree which has been completed abroad.

An employee is entitled to receive, on request, a testimonial of service from their employer at the end of the contract of employment.
A testimonial of service is an important document specifying the duration of the contract of employment and the employee’s tasks.
The employee can also ask that the reason why the contract of employment ended and an estimation of the employee’s skills and behaviour are included in the testimonial.
Even ten years after the contract of employment has ended, the employer is obliged to provide a testimonial of service and, after this, only if it does not cause the employer unreasonable inconvenience.
If the employee wishes to have an estimation of their skills and behaviour included in the testimonial, the employer shall deliver it to the employee on their request up to five years after the contract of employment has ended.
The employer shall also give the employee a new testimonial of service if the employee’s testimonial is lost or gets ruined.
An employer who knowingly or out of carelessness fails to provide a testimonial of service is in breach of the Employment Contracts Act.

An employer shall choose the most distinguished applicant for the task.
The employer must also be able to prove that the choice is justified on acceptable grounds related to the nature of the work and that the choice was not made on discriminatory bases.
Qualities that are not necessary for the performance of the tasks must not be required of job seekers.
Equality in the workplace
An employer shall not discriminate against employees when making decisions about the distribution of tasks, offering advancement opportunities or terminating a contract of employment.

When a child is born to a family, the parents are entitled to family leave, i.e. to stay at home and look after the child.
Family leave signifies
maternity leave
paternity leave
parental leave
child care leave
Notify your employer of your family leave at least two months in advance.
Family leave is usually unpaid vacation.
Whether or not you will be paid for your family leave depends on your collective agreement.
Check the matter from your employer.
Kela pays family allowance for the time of family leave, i.e. parental allowance and home care allowance.
Read about the conditions of family allowance on the InfoFinland pages Benefits for a family after a child is born and Benefits for looking after a child at home.
When the family leave has ended, the employee has the right to return to their own work or to comparable work in their old workplace.
The contract of employment of a pregnant woman cannot be dissolved, nor can she be discriminated against because of her pregnancy.
Employers and employees in Finland are very familiar with these family leaves and they are commonly utilised.

Family leaveFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Information on benefits for families with childrenFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Maternity leave
The duration of maternity leave is 105 weekdays.
Working is allowed during maternity leave if it can take place without endangering the safety of the mother, foetus or child.
However, the mother cannot work while on maternity leave during the two weeks before the expected date of delivery, nor during the two weeks after giving birth.
Paternity leave
Paternity leave is the part of parental leave intended for the father.
The length of paternity leave is 54 weekdays.
These days cannot be transferred to the mother.
You can take a maximum of 18 days of paternity leave at the same time as the mother of your child is on maternity or parental leave.
You can divide these days into up to four periods.
The remaining 36 days can be divided into up to two periods.
During these 36 days, the mother of your child cannot be on parental leave.
The intention is that the father will look after the child.
You can also take all 54 days of paternity leave at a different time than the mother.
You can decide for yourself if you want to have all paternity leave days or only some of them.
Paternity leave can only be used to take care of a child who is under 2 years of age.
When your child turns 2, you can no longer stay on paternity leave even if you have some days left.
Parental leave
After the period of maternity leave, either the mother or father can stay at home to look after the baby on parental leave which is 158 weekdays long.
Both parents cannot take parental leave at the same time.
Parental leave can, however, be divided so that the father and the mother take turns in staying home with the child.
Child care leave
After the parental leave period is over, the father or mother can take unpaid child care leave to look after their child until the child turns 3.
This requires that the mother or father has been working for the same employer for at least 6 months during the past year.
During the child care leave, Kela pays the parent home care allowance.
Read more about the conditions for home care allowance at the InfoFinland page Benefits for looking after a child at home.
Partial child care leave
Child care leave can also be part-time.
This means working shorter hours and being paid correspondingly less.
It is also possible for both parents to take partial child care leave, for example, so that one works in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
You can stay on partial child care leave until your child completes his/her second school grade.
You can apply for partial child care allowance from Kela for looking after a child who is under the age of 3 or in grade 1 or 2 of school if you have a municipality of residence in Finland.
Partial child care allowance is not granted for looking after a child who is three years old or over, but not yet in school.
Read more about partial child care allowance on the InfoFinland web page Benefits for looking after a child at home.

Notify the authorities of the move
You can complete the notice of move online or with a form available at Local Register Offices and post offices.
If you permanently move away from Finland or reside abroad for a continuous period of two years, your residence permit will be revoked.
You can lodge an application with the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto) to prevent the cancellation of the residence permit.
The application must be submitted before you have resided abroad for two years.
More information on the matter is available on the InfoFinland page Can I lose my residence permit?
Moving abroad and social security
When you move to live abroad, you need to inform Kela if you are receiving Kela benefits or if you have a European Health Insurance Card.
If you are receiving Kela benefits, you will normally not lose your right to them if you stay abroad for six months or less.
In that case, your stay abroad is considered temporary and you do not have to inform Kela.
If you stay abroad for 3–6 months, you should inform Kela if
you are receiving general housing allowance;
you are receiving child care allowance; or
you need to buy prescription medicine from a pharmacy for over three months.
If you go to an EU or EEA country for work, you will be covered by the social security system of that country for the duration of your work, even if it is shorter than six months.
In that case, you will not have the right to Kela benefits.
If you move abroad for over six months, the move is considered permanent.
In that case, your right to Kela subsidies ends when you move.
However, in some cases you can maintain your right to Kela benefits even if you stay abroad for over six months.
When you are abroad and have the right to Kela benefits, you must always inform Kela if your circumstances change.
For example, if your family relationships change or if you start working, that may affect your right to Kela benefits.
More information on social security in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Finnish social security.
Voluntary return of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants

If you fall ill or have an accident, you have the right to stay home from work.
Your employer is responsible for paying you salary during your sick leave.
If your employment has continued for more than a month before you fall ill, you will receive full salary for at least the day you fell ill and for nine days after the day you fell ill.
If you are unable to return to work after these ten days, you can apply for sickness allowance (sairauspäiväraha) from Kela, if you are covered by the Finnish social security.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Finnish social security.

If you have completed a degree in another country, you may need a decision of recognition of the degree to be able to work or study in Finland.
In most situations, the employer, educational institute or university assesses the qualifications and competence that your foreign diploma or degree has provided.
You need a recognition decision from the Finnish National Agency for Education or another authority if you want to work in a regulated profession or a position that requires a higher education degree at a specific level.

If you want to continue studies in Finland
Universities and educational institutes decide on student admission.
They also decide whether foreign studies and your other competence can be accepted as a part of the degree you complete in Finland.
If you have completed higher education courses abroad and want to continue your studies in Finland, you can get information and guidance from the student services and SIMHE services of higher education institutes.

Institutes of higher education offering SIMHE servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Jobs that do not require specific training
Not all jobs require specific training or degree level according to Finnish law.
For example, a private sector employer usually assesses independently whether a foreign diploma or degree provides sufficient qualifications for the job.
Comparability of higher education degree levels
Public sector (municipal or state) positions usually require a higher education degree at a specific level, such as a master’s degree.
If you have completed a higher education degree abroad, you can apply to the Finnish National Agency for Education for a decision to recognise your degree as comparable to a certain level.
The decision is subject to a charge.
Once your degree level has been recognised as comparable to a Finnish higher education degree, you can apply for jobs that require that level of higher education.

Regulated professions
Some professions are regulated in Finland.
This means that the education and training required for them is specified in law.
Such jobs include, for example, physiotherapist, doctor, dentist, pharmacist, nurse, attorney, auditor, class teacher and chimney sweeper.
The authorities for each sector make decisions on the right to carry out a regulated profession or use the professional title.
For example, in the social and health care sector, the decision is made by Valvira National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health, and in the education sector, it is made by the Finnish National Agency for Education.
The decision is subject to a charge.
The website of the Finnish National Agency for Education has a list of regulated professions and the decision-making authorities.

Many countries have a diplomatic mission in Finland.
The mission can be either an embassy or consulate.

Everybody has a right to occupational health care
In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
An employer may also arrange for nursing services for their employees.
In occupational health care, it is possible to receive the services of a nurse, occupational doctor and occupational psychologist.
Often there are also physiotherapists.
Occupational health care does not usually include the services of specialists.

The target of occupational health care is to promote health, working capacity and teamwork at workplaces.
Occupational health care staff are bound to professional secrecy.
They will not share your information with your employer unless you specifically give them permission to do so.
Occupational health care can, however, give your employer an evaluation on whether or not your health allows you to continue to work.
Kela compensates a part of the expenses of occupational health care to the employer and entrepreneur if they are necessary and reasonable.

The application is a reply to the job advertisement.
Respond to the wishes and requirements that were mentioned in the job advertisement.
Emphasise the things that are important for the task.
Give concrete examples of your competence.
Assure the employer that you are suitable for the task.
A job application is usually a little under one page long.

Health and safety activities at the workplace
A lot of attention is paid to safety at work in Finland.
Employers are responsible for everyone’s safety while they work.
An employer must organise induction to the workplace for a new employee.
An employer is also obliged to familiarise employees with the safety instructions of a workplace and to teach them correct work methods.
Employees must also look after safety at work themselves.
The work must be performed according to instructions.
If the work is clearly dangerous, an employee can refuse to do it.
Workplaces must have a sufficient number of persons with first aid skills and first aid equipment and instructions must be provided on how to act in emergency situations.
Employers organise first aid training for their staff at work.
If a workplace has at least ten employees, the employees elect a safety officer to represent them.
The safety officer familiarises themselves with the work safety issues that are relevant for the workplace, participates in workplace safety inspections and informs employees of matters relating to work safety and health.
For each workplace, the employer nominates a workplace safety manager who assists the employer in cooperation with the employees and health and safety authorities.
Health and safety authorities
Under the Regional State Administrative Agencies there are five occupational health and safety divisions.
These monitor that work safety instructions are observed at workplaces in accordance with the law.
The health and safety divisions provide guidance for both employees and employers on work safety and health, as well as in matters related to the conditions of the contract of employment.
Work safety inspectors conduct inspections at workplaces.
Among other things, they inspect whether safety regulations are being observed at the workplace, whether sufficient induction to the work has been carried out and whether foreign workers’ working conditions and conditions of employment comply with Finnish laws and agreements.
A work safety inspector is entitled to access every workplace and to see the documents that are necessary for work safety surveillance.
A health and safety authority may oblige an employer to fix any deficiencies discovered in work safety at the workplace.

Employ yourself as a freelancer or an entrepreneur
Freelance work means that you work for several clients without permanent employment based on a contract.
As a freelancer, you must take care of tax matters and pension payments yourself.
You can invoice your work though an invoicing service without establishing your own company.
This is called light entrepreneurship.
You can also start your own business.
Bear in mind that working as a freelancer or an entrepreneur may affect your unemployment benefit.

General information about trade unions
Finnish legislation secures an employee’s right to be a member of a trade union (ammattiliitto).
This right cannot be restricted by any agreements.
Discrimination of employees due to their membership in a trade organisation is a punishable offence.
Most Finns are members of some trade union.
Trade unions strive to secure their members’ benefits and rights, work to improve wages and job security and to develop the quality of working life.
Employees’ associations have unionised under three employees’ central organisations.
These are SAK, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions; STTK, the Finnish Confederation of Professionals and Akava, the Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland.

Joining a trade union and the membership fee
You can join a trade union in your own sector, if you like.
You can join one by contacting a shop steward at your workplace or contacting a trade union directly.
Most trade unions can be joined also by filling in an application form on the union’s website.
The members of a trade union pay the union a membership fee which is usually about 1-2% of their pay.
You can deduct the membership fee from your taxes.
The members of a trade union can participate in training and leisure activities organised by the union.
They also receive support from the union’s shop steward in conflict situations at work.
When needed, the union also provides advice and help in negotiations.
Unemployment fund
In Finland, we have a voluntary unemployment fund system.
An employee who is a member of an unemployment fund pays a membership fee to the unemployment fund while working.
If the work finishes and they become unemployed, they can apply to the unemployment fund for earnings-related daily unemployment allowance.
It pays to join an unemployment fund because the earnings-related daily allowance is greater than ordinary unemployment benefit.
When you join a trade union you can join the union’s unemployment fund.
However, the trade union and unemployment fund are separate systems.
There are also some unemployment funds which you can join without being a member of any trade union.
There are some conditions which have to be met before it is possible to receive an earnings-related daily allowance.
For example, in order to receive it, you have to be a member for a certain time before becoming unemployed.
Find out about these conditions immediately when you join an unemployment fund.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Unemployment benefit.
linkkiFederation of Unemployment Funds in Finland:
Information about unemployment fundsFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Representative of a trade union at the workplace
At workplaces, a trade union and its member workers are represented by a shop steward.
The shop steward is elected by the workers.
The shop steward acts as a negotiator, arbitrator and means of communication between the employer and employees.
You can also ask a shop steward, for example, about issues related to the collective agreement.
Notify the authorities of the move
When moving abroad from Finland, you must notify your Local Register Office (maistraatti) of your move.
You can complete the notice of move online or with a form available at Local Register Offices and post offices.
If you permanently move away from Finland or reside abroad for a continuous period of two years, your residence permit will be revoked.
You can lodge an application with the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto) to prevent the cancellation of the residence permit.
The application must be submitted before you have resided abroad for two years.
More information on the matter is available on the InfoFinland page Can I lose my residence permit?
Moving abroad and social security
When you move to live abroad, you need to inform Kela if you are receiving Kela benefits or if you have a European Health Insurance Card.
If you are receiving Kela benefits, you will normally not lose your right to them if you stay abroad for six months or less.
In that case, your stay abroad is considered temporary and you do not have to inform Kela.
If you stay abroad for 3–6 months, you should inform Kela if
you are receiving general housing allowance;
you are receiving child care allowance; or
you need to buy prescription medicine from a pharmacy for over three months.
If you go to an EU or EEA country for work, you will be covered by the social security system of that country for the duration of your work, even if it is shorter than six months.
In that case, you will not have the right to Kela benefits.
If you move abroad for over six months, the move is considered permanent.
In that case, your right to Kela subsidies ends when you move.
However, in some cases you can maintain your right to Kela benefits even if you stay abroad for over six months.
When you are abroad and have the right to Kela benefits, you must always inform Kela if your circumstances change.
For example, if your family relationships change or if you start working, that may affect your right to Kela benefits.
More information on social security in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Finnish social security.
Voluntary return of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants
If you want to return to your home country, you may in some cases receive assistance for this purpose.
This assistance is either money or service.
The amount of money depends on the country to which you are returning.
Examples of the service include assistance in looking for a home or a job in the country to which you are returning.
You can receive assistance if:
you are an asylum seeker and your application is being processed
you have received a negative decision on your asylum application
you are a victim of human trafficking and do not have a municipality of residence in Finland
you have been granted a temporary residence permit because you cannot be removed from the country
you have received temporary protection
your international protection status in Finland has been withdrawn or cancelled and a decision has been made to deport you.
If you are a customer of a reception centre, you can apply for assisted voluntary return through your own reception centre.
If you are not a customer of a reception centre, you can apply for assisted voluntary return through the Finnish Immigration Service.

Citizenship of a child being born
A child is automatically granted Finnish citizenship at birth, if:
the child’s mother is a Finnish citizen.
the child’s father is a Finnish citizen and the mother is not, but the parents are married to each other.
If, however, the parents are not married, the child is granted Finnish citizenship through the father:
at birth when the child is born in Finland and paternity is confirmed.
via a citizenship notification when the child is born in some other country and paternity has been confirmed.
Finnish citizenship can also be granted to a child born in Finland to foreign parents, if the child is not granted any other citizenship through the parents.
There is more information on the InfoFinland page When a child is born in Finland to parents whose child is born in Finland.
Child’s citizenshipFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Finnish citizenship through notification
The following people can receive Finnish citizenship by means of a citizenship notification (kansalaisuusilmoitus):
Former Finnish citizens
Foreign persons with a father who is a Finnish citizen
Persons between 18 and 22 year of age who have lived in Finland for several years
Adopted children of Finnish citizens between 12 and 17 years of age
Citizens of a Nordic Country who have lived in Finland for the past five years

Citizenship notification formFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Multiple citizenship
Finland allows multiple citizenship, i.e. that you are a citizen of another country in addition to being a Finnish citizen.
However, not all countries allow multiple citizenship.
Before applying for Finnish citizenship, it is advisable to find out whether or not multi-nationality is permitted in the country where you have citizenship.
If the country in question does not allow multiple citizenship, you may lose your status as a citizen of that country when you obtain Finnish citizenship.
Multiple citizenship can be useful but also disadvantageous.
For example, you should check whether you are liable to go into military service in more than one country of citizenship or whether it is sufficient to have a certificate of completed military service from one country.
Multiple citizenship can prove useful, for example, when moving from one country to another or seeking employment.
The Finnish Immigration Service advises on questions about nationality:
Tel. 0295 419 626 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 10:00–11:00
A child’s multiple citizenship
A child can be a citizen of both Finland and another country.
This depends on whether the other country accepts the child’s multiple citizenships (monikansalaisuus).
Ask about it at your own country’s Diplomatic Mission.
Can you lose Finnish citizenship?
Finnish citizenship can be lost in the following cases:
The person is 22 or older, holds citizenship in another country and does not have adequate contact to Finland.
The person has provided false information in the citizenship application or notification.
The person has received Finnish citizenship based on the father’s nationality and the relationship of paternity is disproved.

A contract of employment is made in two identical copies, one for the employee and the other for the employer.
At least the following matters are generally recorded in the contract of employment:
The parties to the contract of employment
Both the employer and employee sign the contract of employment.
The date of commencement of work
Whether the contract is valid for the present or fixed-term
A contract of employment that is valid for the present is the principal rule.
It means that work will continue until the employee resigns or the employer dismisses the employee.
An employer must have a justified reason for dismissing an employee.
Acceptable reasons for dismissal are specified in the Employment Contracts Act.
If a contract of employment is valid for the present it means that the employee has a steady or permanent job.
A fixed-term work contract means that the time of commencement and ending of work have been agreed upon.
A contract of employment can be made for a fixed-term if there are justifiable grounds for it.
Acts and collective agreements determine exactly when fixed-term contracts of employment can be used.
A contract of employment may be fixed-term, for example, for the following reasons:
deputyship
work experience placement
project work peak demand or period
If a contract of employment is fixed-term, it is binding on both parties for the agreed term unless the possibility of dismissal has been agreed upon.
A fixed-term contract can be dissolved only for very weighty reasons.
Probationary period and its duration
A probationary period can be agreed upon at the beginning of the contract of employment.
The probationary period cannot exceed six months.
In fixed-term employment, the probationary period cannot exceed half of the employment contract duration.
During this period, the employee can assess whether the work is suitable for them, and the employer can assess whether the employee is suitable for the task.
During the probationary period, the employee and the employer can dissolve the contract of employment without a period of notice.
The grounds for dissolving the contract of employment during the probationary period must not be discriminating.
During the probationary period, the employee is paid normal remuneration.
Place of work
Duties
Remuneration and its method of payment
Remuneration is determined according to the collective agreement.
If there is no collective agreement in the sector of work, employees are entitled to reasonable remuneration.
An employer must not pay remuneration that is less than stipulated in the collective agreement.
Remuneration can contain various bonuses.
Typical bonuses to remuneration in Finland include experience bonus, overtime pay and extra compensation for shift work.
Payday is usually once or twice a month.
Employers pay remuneration to the employee’s bank account.
Employees are entitled to receive a payslip that shows the different parts which form the remuneration.
When remuneration is discussed in Finland, what is usually meant is gross salary (bruttopalkka) from which tax, employee and employer’s contributions are deducted.
The amount that remains for the employee is net salary (nettopalkka).
Working hours
The contract must specify regular working hours.
Working hours must comply with the Working Hours Act and the collective agreement.
Annual holidays and holiday pay
An employee is entitled to the same remuneration for the holiday period as when working.
In addition, an employee is paid holiday pay.
The payment of holiday pay is based on the collective agreement.
When the contract of employment expires the employee is entitled to holiday compensation for those days for which they have not received holiday or holiday compensation by the end of the contract of employment.
Period of notice
A contract of employment that is valid for the present expires after either the employee’s or employer’s period of notice.
The period of notice signifies the time for the duration of which an employee is obliged to work before the work ends.
During the period of notice, all the normal employees’ rights and obligations apply to the employee and they receive normal remuneration.
If an employer dismisses an employee, they must provide the reason for it.
The Employment Contracts Act specifies acceptable reasons for dismissal.

Many countries have a diplomatic mission in Finland.
The mission can be either an embassy or consulate.
The embassies are located in Helsinki.

Applying for citizenship in your home country if you have lost or relinquished it
Notifying the authorities of your native country of a new child if the child was born in Finland
Applying for citizenship in your native country for your child if the child was born in Finland
Registering your marriage in your native country if you married in Finland

Please note that not all diplomatic missions offer the same services.
Handling all of the matters listed above may not be possible in all diplomatic missions.
The available services depend on the legislation of your home country.
For additional information, contact the diplomatic mission of your native country.
Not all countries have diplomatic missions in Finland.
In these cases you are often served by your native country’s diplomatic mission in one Finland’s neighbouring countries.

This page contains information about the residence-based social security provided by Kela.
The page indicates the situations in which you are considered to be covered by social security that is based on residence.
The InfoFinland page Unemployment benefit contains more information about who is entitled to unemployment security.
Kela manages social security services and benefits, such as the national pension, child benefit, basic unemployment security, sickness and parenthood allowance, income support and rehabilitation.
Kela also provides health care benefits paid for private health care.
If you are covered by Finnish health insurance, you will receive a Kela card.
The grounds for Kela benefits are defined by law.
When you apply for a Kela benefit, Kela checks whether you have a right to receive Kela benefits.
It may be affected by permanent residence and working in Finland.
When deciding on a benefit, Kela reviews the life situation of each applicant individually.
The situations in life and needs for benefit often vary greatly between applicants.
Therefore, the amounts and grounds of the benefits also vary.
Always clarify your own situation separately.
In Finland, public health services and social services are the responsibility of municipalities.

Right to Kela benefits
As a general rule, if you live permanently in Finland, you can receive Kela benefits.
The law defines what is meant by permanent residence.
Working in Finland may also give you a right to Kela benefits.
Do you have a right to benefits?
This is affected by whether you are moving to Finland
from a country belonging to the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland;
from another country.
The EEA countries include the EU countries, along with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
Your right to benefits is also affected by the capacity in which you are moving to Finland, for example:
employee or entrepreneur
student
family member
seconded employee.
Finland has made agreements regarding social security with a number of countries.
They include the Nordic countries, USA, Canada and Quebec, Chile, Israel, India, China, South Korea and Australia.
The agreements primarily apply to pensions.
Some of them also concern health care.
If you are coming from one of these countries, check with Kela whether or not these agreements affect your social security.

Moving to Finland permanently and living in Finland permanently
When you move to Finland, Kela always first assesses whether or not you are moving to live in the country permanently, as defined by the social security legislation.
If Kela considers your move to Finland as not permanent, you may still have a right to Kela benefits based on your work.
You may be considered to be moving to Finland permanently in the following cases, for example:
You are a returnee, i.e. you are returning to Finland from abroad.
You have a permanent employment contract, or similar agreement, regarding work you will be doing in Finland.
You are married to or in an otherwise close family relationship with a person who is already a permanent resident of Finland.
In addition, if you are obliged to obtain a residence permit, it is usually required that your permit is valid.
An overall assessment of the situation will be prepared.
Based on this, it will be considered whether or not your residence is permanent.
If you are moving to Finland temporarily, you are not entitled to Kela benefits.
Starting from 1 April 2019, a student from outside the EU and EEA area may have a right to some Kela benefits, such as health insurance benefits.
Once the ruling has been made that you are a permanent resident of Finland, you will be regarded as such for as long as:
you have your primary residence and home in the country, and you spend most of your time in Finland
or
you have some other reason for your permanent residence in Finland, such as a family tie or work.
However, if you begin work in another country or go abroad for more than six months, your right to Kela benefits may be terminated.
More information about these situations is available from Kela.
There are also benefits that you cannot receive if you are not, or have not previously been, a permanent resident of Finland.
For example, parents can only receive parenthood allowance if they have lived in Finland for at least 180 days directly before the child’s expected date of delivery.
If you are coming from another EU country, however, you can in some cases utilise the insurance periods you have accumulated in the other EU country.

If your wage amounts to at least €696.60 per month, you have a right to most Kela benefits.
It does not matter how many hours you work per week or how long your employment contract is.

Asylum seeker
Asylum seekers are not entitled to social security in Finland.
This means that they cannot obtain social security benefits from Kela.
The reception centre pays asylum seekers a reception allowance.
The allowance is paid until the asylum application has been processed.
The reception allowance is a small amount of money intended for necessary expenses.
Asylum seekers who are granted a residence permit and who live permanently in Finland are entitled to social security in Finland.
Persons who have been granted a residence permit can apply for coverage under the Finnish social security system from Kela.
In Finland, an employee’s rights are determined according to labour legislation and collective agreements (työehtosopimus).
These specify, for example, minimum wages, working hours, holidays, sick pay and the conditions of terminating a contract of employment.
Employers’ associations and employees’ associations work together to agree on the working conditions in a certain field.
This leads to the creation of collective agreements (TES).
In the public sector (with the state or a municipality as an employer) a collective bargaining contract on civil servant salaries (VES) or a general municipal collective bargaining contract (KVTES) is agreed upon.
The agreed upon benefits in a collective agreement are always minimum benefits.
They cannot be less in the contract of employment.
For example, remuneration cannot be smaller than that which has been agreed upon in the collective agreement.
However, an employer and employee can agree on better conditions in the contract of employment than those stipulated in the collective agreement.
Collective agreements are concluded for a fixed period of time, usually for a year or two or even longer.
A collective agreement and a collective bargaining contract on civil servant salaries are binding to the employees’ and employers’ associations and their members.
A collective agreement can also be generally binding.
In such a case, also employers who are not members of an employers’ association have to comply with the agreement and apply it to their employees.
Job advertisements and contracts of employment may read: “palkkaus TES:in mukainen” (“remuneration according to collective agreement”).
It makes sense to find out the size of remuneration within your own field in Finland.
It is important to know the collective agreement because in Finland there is no act on minimum wage, for example; instead, minimum wages are always determined according to the collective agreement.

Contract of employment
An employer usually makes a written contract of employment with a new employee.
The contract of employment states the employee’s tasks and remuneration and other benefits and conditions related to work.
This contract can also be verbal.
If no written contract of employment has been made, the employer shall, without a specific request, provide a written account of the central conditions of work.
It is advisable to make a written contract of employment.
When matters have been written down, both employee and employer can check the contract for what has been jointly agreed upon.
This will help in cases of conflict at work.

Equality has been written into the Finnish law
Equal treatment of all people is guaranteed by Finland’s constitution.
Equality (yhdenvertaisuus) means that all people are equal regardless of their sex, age, ethnic or national origin, nationality, language, religion or beliefs, opinion, disability, health, sexual orientation or any other circumstance connected to the person.
Issues on equality in working life are enacted in the Equality Act and Employment Contracts Act.
They state that employees must be treated equally as regards employment, working conditions, conditions of employment, staff training and career advancement.

Equality in recruitment
The Equality Act (yhdenvertaisuuslaki) provides that job seekers are treated equally.
An employer shall choose the most distinguished applicant for the task.
The employer must also be able to prove that the choice is justified on acceptable grounds related to the nature of the work and that the choice was not made on discriminatory bases.
Qualities that are not necessary for the performance of the tasks must not be required of job seekers.
Equality in the workplace
An employer shall not discriminate against employees when making decisions about the distribution of tasks, offering advancement opportunities or terminating a contract of employment.
Discrimination at work is a crime.
If you suspect that you have been the object of discrimination at work, you can contact the occupational safety and health authorities or your own trade union.
In problem situations, you can ask a safety officer or shop steward for advice.

Equality (tasa-arvo) between men and women
According to Finnish law, men and women are equal.
Men and women must be treated equally in employment, working conditions and remuneration.
An employee must not be set in an unequal position in working life due to pregnancy or parenthood.
The Finnish Act on Equality between Women and Men stipulates that an employer shall supervise that sexual equality is realised and that nobody is discriminated against at the workplace.
An Equality Ombudsman monitors that the Act on Equality between Women and Men is observed.
If you suspect that your employer has discriminated against you because of your sex, you can ask an Equality Ombudsman for advice and guidance and help in solving the issue.

If you need to deal with Finnish authorities and you do not speak Finnish or Swedish and have no other common language with the authority, you are sometimes entitled to interpreting services.
In these cases, the authorities will book you an interpreter and pay for the services.
Authorities can arrange and pay for interpretation when the processing of the matter in question has been initiated by the said authorities.
However, this is not always possible.
If you need an interpreter for the initial assessment and integration plan, it is the responsibility of the authority to book one.
You can ask about the matter from the authorities in advance.
If you are seeking asylum in Finland, you are entitled to interpretation in matters related to the processing of your asylum application.
You are entitled to receive information about decisions concerning you in your native language or a language that you understand.
Information on decisions is provided through interpretation or translation.
If you book and pay for an interpreter yourself, you can use an interpreter whenever you want.
Interpreter servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
What does an interpreter do?
An interpreter will accompany you to meetings with authorities.
He or she will interpret the discussion between you and the authority.
The interpreter will either be present or the interpretation services will be provided via a telephone or video connection.
The task of the interpreter is to interpret the discussion between you and the authority.
The interpreter will not handle any tasks other than interpretation.
Therefore, he or she cannot assist you in any other matters.
The interpreter is an impartial third party; he or she will not take your or the authority’s side.
Interpreters are sworn to secrecy, which means that they cannot disclose information about your affairs to others.
Where to book an interpreter?
There are eight interpreting centres (tulkkikeskus) in Finland, which are maintained by municipalities.
The services of interpreting centres are primarily intended for authorities that work with immigrants.
Many companies also provide interpretation services.

Citizenship of a child being born
A child is automatically granted Finnish citizenship at birth, if:
the child’s mother is a Finnish citizen.
the child’s father is a Finnish citizen and the mother is not, but the parents are married to each other.
If, however, the parents are not married, the child is granted Finnish citizenship through the father:
at birth when the child is born in Finland and paternity is confirmed.
via a citizenship notification when the child is born in some other country and paternity has been confirmed.
Finnish citizenship can also be granted to a child born in Finland to foreign parents, if the child is not granted any other citizenship through the parents.
There is more information on the InfoFinland page When a child is born in Finland to parents whose child is born in Finland.
Child’s citizenshipFinnish _ Swedish _ English

Foreign persons with a father who is a Finnish citizen
Persons between 18 and 22 year of age who have lived in Finland for several years
Adopted children of Finnish citizens between 12 and 17 years of age
Citizens of a Nordic Country who have lived in Finland for the past five years

Citizenship notification formFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Multiple citizenship
Finland allows multiple citizenship, i.e. that you are a citizen of another country in addition to being a Finnish citizen.
However, not all countries allow multiple citizenship.
Before applying for Finnish citizenship, it is advisable to find out whether or not multi-nationality is permitted in the country where you have citizenship.
If the country in question does not allow multiple citizenship, you may lose your status as a citizen of that country when you obtain Finnish citizenship.
Multiple citizenship can be useful but also disadvantageous.
For example, you should check whether you are liable to go into military service in more than one country of citizenship or whether it is sufficient to have a certificate of completed military service from one country.
Multiple citizenship can prove useful, for example, when moving from one country to another or seeking employment.
The Finnish Immigration Service advises on questions about nationality:
Tel. 0295 419 626 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 10:00–11:00
A child’s multiple citizenship
A child can be a citizen of both Finland and another country.
This depends on whether the other country accepts the child’s multiple citizenships (monikansalaisuus).
Ask about it at your own country’s Diplomatic Mission.
Can you lose Finnish citizenship?
Finnish citizenship can be lost in the following cases:
The person is 22 or older, holds citizenship in another country and does not have adequate contact to Finland.
The person has provided false information in the citizenship application or notification.
The person has received Finnish citizenship based on the father’s nationality and the relationship of paternity is disproved.
Losing your Finnish citizenshipFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Bank account
You need a bank account in order to handle your finances.
It’s a good idea to compare the services and prices of different banks so that you will find the most advantageous option for you.
When opening a bank account, you need a passport, identity card for foreign citizens or some other official identity card.
If you do not have a passport or identity card for foreign citizens, it is a good idea to check what kind of proof of identity the bank accepts.
Some banks accept an alien's passport granted by a Finnish authority, a refugee travel document or other proof of identity which can be accepted as travel document.
In some cases, the bank may also require other proof of identity if your document states that your identity could not be verified.
You cannot prove your identity with a driving licence.
According to law, when you open a bank account, the bank must ask you to clarify for what purpose you intend to use your bank account.
The bank also has the right to check your credit history.
The bank needs the following information from you:
personal identity code
address in Finland or abroad
if you pay taxes to a country other than Finland, your address in that other country
the same information on persons entitled to use the bank account.
It is a good idea to also acquire online banking credentials when opening a bank account.
With online banking credentials you can, for example, attend to many official matters online.
However, the requirements for obtaining online banking credentials are stricter than those for opening a bank account.
Thus, in some cases, you cannot get online banking credentials even if you have a bank account.
If you want to ask for advice on banking matters, you can call the Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau (FINE).
The service is free of charge, in other words, you only pay the price of the phone call.
The service is available in Finnish, Swedish and English.

Foreigner’s identity card
The police can issue you with a foreigner’s identity card if you have been identified and your identity has been reliably verified.
Your identity can be verified from a document that proves your identity.
If you do not have such a document, your fingerprints can be compared to the fingerprints stored on your residence permit card or residence card.
Other requirements that must be met:
you have a valid residence permit or residence card, or your right to reside has been registered;
you have a municipality of residence in Finland;
your information has been saved in the Finnish Population Information System.
You can use a foreigner’s identity card to prove your identity in Finland.

Insurance
It is recommendable to take out home insurance.
Home insurance covers, for example, damage to your furniture and other articles.
Home insurance policies are sold by insurance companies.
According to law, you must take out motor insurance if you use your own car.
If you want to take out a motor insurance policy from a Finnish insurance company, you normally need a Finnish personal health insurance card, the Kela card.
Insurance of the person include, for example, accident insurance, medical expenses insurance and life insurance.

Telephone
When you buy a telephone subscription in Finland, you get a Finnish phone number.
Many companies sell telephone subscriptions.
When you take out a telephone subscription, you must have a Finnish personal identity code and an address in Finland.
Normally, you must also provide information on your payment behaviour, in other words, that you have paid your bills and that you don't have a payment default entry recorded in your credit history.
Otherwise, you need to make an advance payment for the subscription.
You can also buy a pre-paid subscription.
In this case, you don't need a Finnish personal identity code or an address in Finland.
A pre-paid card has a certain sum charged into it beforehand which you use to make phone calls.
Pre-paid subscriptions are sold, for example, at R-kiosks, some supermarkets or over the internet.
When calling abroad by phone, it’s wise to check which international dialling codes are the most affordable.
Many companies offer affordable international dialling codes.
Please note, however, that the price of a phone call always depends on the country you call.
Make sure that you know what is the most inexpensive option for you.

If you have completed a foreign degree, you might benefit from having the degree compared to a Finnish degree, having your professional qualification recognised, acquiring a right to practice your profession or completing a competence-based qualification.
Equivalence and recognition of degrees
Recognition of a degree is a decision about which qualifications a degree completed in a foreign country gives you to work or apply for a student position in Finland.
Recognition of a degree is subject to a charge and is requested from the Finnish National Board of Education.
When you are applying for a student position, recognition of a degree is not necessarily needed.
Professional recognition and the right to practise a profession
Persons applying for positions in the public sector (the state and municipalities) often need to meet certain educational qualification requirements.
When a person who has completed his or her studies abroad applies for such position, he or she usually needs a decision issued by the Finnish National Board of Education stating that his or her degree qualifies for the position.
The applicants of a position in a regulated profession must hold a certain degree stipulated in legislation or certain studies.
Regulated professions include some public sector jobs and positions that require a right to practise that profession.
The right to practise a profession is required for example in health care and seafaring positions.
If you have a foreign degree in a profession that is regulated in Finland, you need to get an equivalence decision from a competent authority before you can practise your profession in Finland.
The Finnish National Board of Education website contains a list of regulated professions and competent authorities for each of them.
Private sector employers evaluate independently whether they will accept an employee’s foreign degree.
Recognition decisions are not required in the private sector, but they may be useful when applying for a position.
The Finnish National Board of Education also issues expert statements on foreign vocational degrees.
These statements, however, do not grant eligibility for civil service posts. They may, nevertheless, be helpful when looking for a job or a place to study, as they describe the content and level of education received abroad.
Academic recognition
If you wish to continue your studies in Finland, the studies you have completed abroad may be taken into consideration through academic recognition.
Academic recognition of degrees entails
seeking a place of study on the basis of foreign education
Recognition of studies completed abroad towards a degree to be completed in Finland.
Educational institutions make independent decisions on their student selections and also on whether or not they accept studies completed abroad as a part of a Finnish degree.
Ask for more information directly from the institution you would like to study at.

This page contains information about the residence-based social security provided by Kela.
The page indicates the situations in which you are considered to be covered by social security that is based on residence.
The InfoFinland page Unemployment benefit contains more information about who is entitled to unemployment security.
Kela manages social security services and benefits, such as the national pension, child benefit, basic unemployment security, sickness and parenthood allowance, income support and rehabilitation.
Kela also provides health care benefits paid for private health care.
If you are covered by Finnish health insurance, you will receive a Kela card.
The grounds for Kela benefits are defined by law.
When you apply for a Kela benefit, Kela checks whether you have a right to receive Kela benefits.
It may be affected by permanent residence and working in Finland.
When deciding on a benefit, Kela reviews the life situation of each applicant individually.
The situations in life and needs for benefit often vary greatly between applicants.
Therefore, the amounts and grounds of the benefits also vary.
Always clarify your own situation separately.
In Finland, public health services and social services are the responsibility of municipalities.

Right to Kela benefits
As a general rule, if you live permanently in Finland, you can receive Kela benefits.
The law defines what is meant by permanent residence.
Working in Finland may also give you a right to Kela benefits.
Do you have a right to benefits?
This is affected by whether you are moving to Finland
from a country belonging to the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland;
from another country.
The EEA countries include the EU countries, along with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
Your right to benefits is also affected by the capacity in which you are moving to Finland, for example:
employee or entrepreneur
student
family member
seconded employee.
Finland has made agreements regarding social security with a number of countries.
They include the Nordic countries, USA, Canada and Quebec, Chile, Israel, India, China, South Korea and Australia.
The agreements primarily apply to pensions.
Some of them also concern health care.
If you are coming from one of these countries, check with Kela whether or not these agreements affect your social security.

Moving to Finland permanently and living in Finland permanently
When you move to Finland, Kela always first assesses whether or not you are moving to live in the country permanently, as defined by the social security legislation.
If Kela considers your move to Finland as not permanent, you may still have a right to Kela benefits based on your work.
You may be considered to be moving to Finland permanently in the following cases, for example:
You are a returnee, i.e. you are returning to Finland from abroad.
You have a permanent employment contract, or similar agreement, regarding work you will be doing in Finland.
You are married to or in an otherwise close family relationship with a person who is already a permanent resident of Finland.
In addition, if you are obliged to obtain a residence permit, it is usually required that your permit is valid.
An overall assessment of the situation will be prepared.
Based on this, it will be considered whether or not your residence is permanent.
If you are moving to Finland temporarily, you are not entitled to Kela benefits.
Starting from 1 April 2019, a student from outside the EU and EEA area may have a right to some Kela benefits, such as health insurance benefits.
Once the ruling has been made that you are a permanent resident of Finland, you will be regarded as such for as long as:
you have your primary residence and home in the country, and you spend most of your time in Finland
or
you have some other reason for your permanent residence in Finland, such as a family tie or work.
However, if you begin work in another country or go abroad for more than six months, your right to Kela benefits may be terminated.
More information about these situations is available from Kela.
There are also benefits that you cannot receive if you are not, or have not previously been, a permanent resident of Finland.
For example, parents can only receive parenthood allowance if they have lived in Finland for at least 180 days directly before the child’s expected date of delivery.
If you are coming from another EU country, however, you can in some cases utilise the insurance periods you have accumulated in the other EU country.

The purpose of the initial assessment is to assess the services you need to support your integration.
The initial assessment collects information on your education, work experience and language skills, for example.
The initial assessment is conducted at an Employment and Economic Development Office (työ- ja elinkeinotoimisto) or in your municipality.
The assessment can also be conducted in another location, such as an educational institute.
This depends on how the initial assessment has been organised in your municipality of residence.
You can request the initial assessment from the Employment and Economic Development Office or your local Social Office, for example.
Immigrant advisors can provide more information on the initial assessment and how it is organised in your municipality of residence.

are an unemployed job seeker, or
you receive income support, or
you are under 18 years old and do not have a guardian in Finland.
An integration plan is a plan detailing measures that will aid your integration.
The integration plan can include Finnish language studies, other education or practical training, for example.
You can prepare the plan together with a job counsellor at an Employment and Economic Development Office or TE office (TE toimisto) or with a social worker at a Social Office.
The integration plan must be made no later than three years after you receive your first residence permit or your right of residence has been registered.
The duration of the plan depends on how long you require support for integration.
Normally, the maximum duration for an integration plan is three years.
In some special cases, the plan can be extended to five years.
Once your integration plan has been prepared, it is important that you adhere to it.
Your TE office or municipality will guide you to integration training, if necessary.
The training usually includes Finnish or Swedish language studies as well as an introduction to Finnish society, culture and working life.
In addition, the training may include other education or practical training.
The TE office, Kela or municipality will determine your right to receive unemployment benefit or income support for the time of your integration plan.
If you have a job, your employer can sometimes help you in the integration process.
For example, the employer can pay for your Finnish language course, for example.
Employers can also sometimes help you to take care of various practical things, such as obtaining housing.
For more information, ask your employer.

If you need to deal with Finnish authorities and you do not speak Finnish or Swedish and have no other common language with the authority, you are sometimes entitled to interpreting services.
In these cases, the authorities will book you an interpreter and pay for the services.
Authorities can arrange and pay for interpretation when the processing of the matter in question has been initiated by the said authorities.
However, this is not always possible.
If you need an interpreter for the initial assessment and integration plan, it is the responsibility of the authority to book one.
You can ask about the matter from the authorities in advance.
If you are seeking asylum in Finland, you are entitled to interpretation in matters related to the processing of your asylum application.
You are entitled to receive information about decisions concerning you in your native language or a language that you understand.
Information on decisions is provided through interpretation or translation.
If you book and pay for an interpreter yourself, you can use an interpreter whenever you want.
Interpreter servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
What does an interpreter do?
An interpreter will accompany you to meetings with authorities.
He or she will interpret the discussion between you and the authority.
The interpreter will either be present or the interpretation services will be provided via a telephone or video connection.
The task of the interpreter is to interpret the discussion between you and the authority.
The interpreter will not handle any tasks other than interpretation.
Therefore, he or she cannot assist you in any other matters.
The interpreter is an impartial third party; he or she will not take your or the authority’s side.
Interpreters are sworn to secrecy, which means that they cannot disclose information about your affairs to others.
Where to book an interpreter?
There are eight interpreting centres (tulkkikeskus) in Finland, which are maintained by municipalities.
The services of interpreting centres are primarily intended for authorities that work with immigrants.
Many companies also provide interpretation services.

Who is an asylum seeker?
An asylum seeker is a person who seeks protection and right of residence in a different country.
International protection can be given to a person who has a justified reason to fear persecution (due to origin, religion, nationality, membership in a specific group or political opinion) or who would otherwise be in real danger in their home country or country of permanent residence.
This means that an asylum seeker is not a refugee.
If an asylum seeker is granted refugee status or a residence permit based on protection or on other grounds, they can stay in Finland.

An asylum seeker's right of residence
You can stay in Finland if you are granted asylum or a residence permit on other grounds.
If the conditions in your home country are such that you do not need asylum and there are no other grounds for granting a residence permit, your application will be rejected, and you will be expelled from Finland.
If your asylum application or residence permit application is rejected, you can appeal the decision.

Seeking asylum in FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Social security
Asylum seekers are not entitled to social security in Finland.
This means that they cannot obtain social security benefits from Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland).
The reception centre pays asylum seekers a reception allowance.
The allowance is paid until the asylum application has been processed.
The reception allowance is a small amount of money intended for necessary expenses.
Asylum seekers who are granted a residence permit and who live permanently in Finland are entitled to social security in Finland.
Persons who have been granted a residence permit can apply for coverage under the Finnish social security system from Kela.
Family reunification
Asylum seekers are not entitled to family reunification arrangements.
Your family members cannot receive a residence permit for Finland based on a family tie.
If you receive a residence permit for Finland, your family members can apply for a permit on the basis of a family tie.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Moving to Finland as a family member.
Applying for a residence permit on the basis of family tiesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Health
Asylum seekers cannot normally use public health services, such as health centres, directly.
Instead, the reception centre arranges health services for them.
The reception centre's public health nurse refers the asylum seeker to medical care.
More information is available at your reception centre.
If you are granted a residence permit and have a municipality of residence in Finland, you are entitled to use the public health services of your municipality, similarly to all citizens of your municipality.

Notify the authorities of the move
When moving abroad from Finland, you must notify your Local Register Office (maistraatti) of your move.
You can complete the notice of move online or with a form available at Local Register Offices and post offices.
If you permanently move away from Finland or reside abroad for a continuous period of two years, your residence permit will be revoked.
You can lodge an application with the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto) to prevent the cancellation of the residence permit.
The application must be submitted before you have resided abroad for two years.
More information on the matter is available on the InfoFinland page Can I lose my residence permit?
Moving abroad and social security
When you move abroad or leave Finland for a period longer than a short holiday, you must also notify the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela).
If you are covered by Finnish social security and leave the country for no longer than a year, you will usually retain your entitlement to Finnish social security during your stay abroad.
If you relocate to an EU or EEA country for work, you will be covered by the social security system in the country where you work even if your stay is shorter than one year.
If this is the case, you are no longer eligible for Finnish social security.
If you move abroad for a period exceeding a year, your move is considered permanent.
This ends your entitlement to Finnish social security upon your moving away from Finland.
However, in some cases you can maintain your right to Finnish social security even if you stay abroad for more than a year.
This option is available to students, for example.
It also applies to workers who a Finnish employer has assigned abroad.
The requirement is that you have submitted an application regarding the matter within a year of going abroad.
If you move to an EU or EEA country or Switzerland as a seconded employee (lähetetty työntekijä), your employer must apply for the E101/A1 certificate for you from the Finnish Centre for Pensions.
It must be applied for before you leave the country.
This certificate enables you to indicate that you are covered by Finnish social security even though you are working abroad.

Bank account
You need a bank account in order to handle your finances.
It’s a good idea to compare the services and prices of different banks so that you will find the most advantageous option for you.
When opening a bank account, you need a passport, identity card for foreign citizens or some other official identity card.
If you do not have a passport or identity card for foreign citizens, it is a good idea to check what kind of proof of identity the bank accepts.
Some banks accept an alien's passport granted by a Finnish authority, a refugee travel document or other proof of identity which can be accepted as travel document.
In some cases, the bank may also require other proof of identity if your document states that your identity could not be verified.
You cannot prove your identity with a driving licence.
According to law, when you open a bank account, the bank must ask you to clarify for what purpose you intend to use your bank account.
The bank also has the right to check your credit history.
The bank needs the following information from you:
personal identity code
address in Finland or abroad
if you pay taxes to a country other than Finland, your address in that other country
the same information on persons entitled to use the bank account.
It is a good idea to also acquire online banking credentials when opening a bank account.
With online banking credentials you can, for example, attend to many official matters online.
However, the requirements for obtaining online banking credentials are stricter than those for opening a bank account.
Thus, in some cases, you cannot get online banking credentials even if you have a bank account.
If you want to ask for advice on banking matters, you can call the Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau (FINE).
The service is free of charge, in other words, you only pay the price of the phone call.
The service is available in Finnish, Swedish and English.

Foreigner’s identity card
The police can issue you with a foreigner’s identity card if you have been identified and your identity has been reliably verified.
Your identity can be verified from a document that proves your identity.
If you do not have such a document, your fingerprints can be compared to the fingerprints stored on your residence permit card or residence card.
Other requirements that must be met:
you have a valid residence permit or residence card, or your right to reside has been registered;
you have a municipality of residence in Finland;
your information has been saved in the Finnish Population Information System.
You can use a foreigner’s identity card to prove your identity in Finland.
You can use it for example when opening a bank account in Finland.
However, you cannot use it as a travel document when travelling abroad.

Insurance
It is recommendable to take out home insurance.
Home insurance covers, for example, damage to your furniture and other articles.
Home insurance policies are sold by insurance companies.
According to law, you must take out motor insurance if you use your own car.
If you want to take out a motor insurance policy from a Finnish insurance company, you normally need a Finnish personal health insurance card, the Kela card.
Insurance of the person include, for example, accident insurance, medical expenses insurance and life insurance.

Telephone
When you buy a telephone subscription in Finland, you get a Finnish phone number.
Many companies sell telephone subscriptions.
When you take out a telephone subscription, you must have a Finnish personal identity code and an address in Finland.
Normally, you must also provide information on your payment behaviour, in other words, that you have paid your bills and that you don't have a payment default entry recorded in your credit history.
Otherwise, you need to make an advance payment for the subscription.
You can also buy a pre-paid subscription.
In this case, you don't need a Finnish personal identity code or an address in Finland.
A pre-paid card has a certain sum charged into it beforehand which you use to make phone calls.
Pre-paid subscriptions are sold, for example, at R-kiosks, some supermarkets or over the internet.
When calling abroad by phone, it’s wise to check which international dialling codes are the most affordable.
Many companies offer affordable international dialling codes.
Please note, however, that the price of a phone call always depends on the country you call.
Make sure that you know what is the most inexpensive option for you.

Who is a refugee?
A refugee is a person with refugee status.
This status is granted to those who gain asylum in Finland or are accepted into the country in the refugee quota.
Quota refugees
You cannot apply to become a quota refugee (kiintiöpakolainen) through Finnish officials.
Nor is it possible to suggest another person, such as a friend or a relative, as a quota refugee.
Finland accepts as quota refugees persons who are considered refugees by the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
Quota refugees are selected from among the persons proposed to Finland by the UNHCR.
Finnish authorities interview the refugees proposed by the UNHCR and, on the basis of these interviews, select the persons who will be admitted to Finland.
The interviews are performed in the refugees’ countries of residence, usually in refugee camps or the UNHCR’s premises.
For example, the following issues influence the selection of quota refugees:
a refugee requires international protection
a refugee’s human rights are not realised in the country where they are residing
a refugee is not a threat to Finland’s security
a refugee has the requirements to become integrated into Finnish society.
Some of the refugees are selected without an interview on the basis of UNHCR’s documents.
They are usually urgent cases, i.e. refugees who need asylum urgently, for example, for political or health-related reasons.
The Parliament of Finland decides how many refugees are accepted into the country.
From 2001, Finland’s refugee quota has been 750 persons per year.
The Ministry of the Interior decides on the countries from which quota refugees are accepted.
Granting refugee status to asylum seekers
You can also receive refugee status if you apply for asylum in Finland.
An asylum seeker can be granted refugee status if they have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in their native country for reasons of origin, religion, nationality, belonging to a certain social group or having a political opinion and, for this reason, are unable to return to their native country.
An asylum seeker who is not granted a refugee status can, however, receive a residence permit for Finland on some other grounds.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Coming to Finland as an asylum seeker.
Information on the selection of quota refugeesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Family reunification
The family members of a refugee can also receive a residence permit for Finland.
The law defines the eligible family members.
Only these family members can receive a residence permit based on a family tie.
In Finland, the following are considered family members:
a partner in a registered partnership
common-law husband or wife
the guardian of a child under the age of 18
In some cases, a refugee is required to have sufficient income to support his or her family members in Finland for those family members to receive a residence permit.
More information on family reunification can be found on the InfoFinland page Moving to Finland to be with a family member.
Assistance for family reunification
If you have come to Finland as a quota refugee, the Finnish Immigration Service may reimburse the costs caused by your family member’s trip to the country.
However, the costs are reimbursed only if the family tie existed before you received your first residence permit for Finland.
The travel costs of other family members will not be reimbursed.
Refugees outside the quota cannot receive compensation for the travel costs of their family members.
The Finnish Red Cross assists quota refugees in travel arrangements
The Finnish Immigration Service will only reimburse the travel expenses in the event that the family member in question travels to Finland by means organised by the Finnish Red Cross or the International Organisation for Migration.
The Finnish Red Cross assists in organising the journey of the family members of a quota refugee to Finland once the family members have been granted a residence permit.
The Red Cross also provides counselling on matters relating to the rules of family reunification and what family members need to do in order to apply for family reunification.
When the Finnish Immigration Service has made a positive decision on your application based on family ties and has resolved that the state can finance your family members’ journey, it supplies a copy of the decision to the Red Cross.
If you arrived in Finland as a quota refugee and you want the Finnish state to finance your family members’ journey, contact the Red Cross’ preparedness unit and they will begin to organise the journey.
The Finnish Red Cross cannot provide financial assistance for family members’ plane tickets or other travel costs.

Health
If you have come to Finland as a quota refugee, you have a municipality of residence in Finland and you are entitled to use public health services.
Support for refugees
Refugees and asylum seekers can find help and guidance in legal questions, for example, at the Refugee Advice Centre or Legal Aid Offices (oikeusaputoimisto).
The Refugee Advice Centre provides asylum seekers with legal aid at the initial stage of the asylum process.
It also gives general legal advice to other foreigners.
The Legal Aid Offices provide persons living in Finland with expert help in dealing with legal matters.
In managing legal matters, it is possible to get a legal adviser funded partly or completely by public funds.
The Finnish Refugee Council (Suomen Pakolaisapu ry) is an organisation that strives to promote refugees’ basic rights.
This organisation performs communication, educational and social work in Finland.
The Refugee Council helps refugees and immigrants, for example, in matters relating to integration, housing and founding their own organisations.

Continuing education is provided by educational institutes, trade organisations and the Institute for Occupational Advancement, among other organisations.
Many employers also train their own employees in the use of new equipment or software, for example.
Studying is more than just learning a new profession.
Studying can also be a hobby.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Studying as a hobby.
Basic information on continuing educationFinnish _ Swedish
Social security
You can be covered by Finnish social security based on either permanent residence or work.
The majority of Kela benefits require you to move to Finland permanently to be entitled to them.
In addition, you must meet the same requirements for benefits as other residents of Finland.
If you move to Finland for work, you will usually get a right to Kela benefits for the duration of your employment contract even if you have a short contract.
If your wage amounts to at least €696.60 per month, you have a right to most Kela benefits.
It does not matter how many hours you work per week or how long your employment contract is.
If you work in Finland, it is recommended to become a member of a Finnish unemployment fund.
If you are a member of an unemployment fund, you can receive earnings-related daily unemployment allowance, if you become unemployed.

Health
Health care for employees and entrepreneurs
If you have come to Finland to work, you may be entitled to use public health services in Finland.
This depends on the duration and type of your contract of employment, as well as on the country from which you have come to Finland.
You can ask Kela to determine whether you are entitled to public health services.
More information on public health care can be found on the InfoFinland web page Health services in Finland.
In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
Entrepreneurs can organise occupational health care for themselves, if they wish.
In other words, entrepreneurs are not under an obligation to arrange occupational health care for themselves.
An entrepreneur is, however, required to organise occupational health care for any employees working for them.
Occupational health care can be arranged at a local health centre or, for example, private clinic.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Occupational health care and on the website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

If you lose your job
If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
Problems in working life
If you face problems at your workplace, contact your supervisor first.
If the issue cannot be resolved at the workplace, contact your local occupational safety district or your trade union.
Information and instructions on how to get help for various problems in working life can be found on the InfoFinland page Problems in working life.

Who is an asylum seeker?
An asylum seeker is a person who seeks protection and right of residence in a different country.
International protection can be given to a person who has a justified reason to fear persecution (due to origin, religion, nationality, membership in a specific group or political opinion) or who would otherwise be in real danger in their home country or country of permanent residence.
This means that an asylum seeker is not a refugee.
If an asylum seeker is granted refugee status or a residence permit based on protection or on other grounds, they can stay in Finland.

An asylum seeker's right of residence
You can stay in Finland if you are granted asylum or a residence permit on other grounds.
If the conditions in your home country are such that you do not need asylum and there are no other grounds for granting a residence permit, your application will be rejected, and you will be expelled from Finland.
If your asylum application or residence permit application is rejected, you can appeal the decision.

Seeking asylum in FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Social security
Asylum seekers are not entitled to social security in Finland.
This means that they cannot obtain social security benefits from Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland).
The reception centre pays asylum seekers a reception allowance.
The allowance is paid until the asylum application has been processed.
The reception allowance is a small amount of money intended for necessary expenses.
Asylum seekers who are granted a residence permit and who live permanently in Finland are entitled to social security in Finland.
Persons who have been granted a residence permit can apply for coverage under the Finnish social security system from Kela.
Family reunification
Asylum seekers are not entitled to family reunification arrangements.
Your family members cannot receive a residence permit for Finland based on a family tie.
If you receive a residence permit for Finland, your family members can apply for a permit on the basis of a family tie.
Read more on the InfoFinland page Moving to Finland as a family member.
Applying for a residence permit on the basis of family tiesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Health
Asylum seekers cannot normally use public health services, such as health centres, directly.
Instead, the reception centre arranges health services for them.
The reception centre's public health nurse refers the asylum seeker to medical care.
More information is available at your reception centre.
If you are granted a residence permit and have a municipality of residence in Finland, you are entitled to use the public health services of your municipality, similarly to all citizens of your municipality.
Health care for undocumented migrants

the child’s father is a Finnish citizen and the mother is not, but the parents are married to each other.
If, however, the parents are not married, the child is granted Finnish citizenship through the father:
at birth when the child is born in Finland and paternity is confirmed.
via a citizenship notification when the child is born in some other country and paternity has been confirmed.
Finnish citizenship can also be granted to a child born in Finland to foreign parents, if the child is not granted any other citizenship through the parents.

Citizenship notification formFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Multiple citizenship
Finland allows multiple citizenship, i.e. that you are a citizen of another country in addition to being a Finnish citizen.
However, not all countries allow multiple citizenship.
Before applying for Finnish citizenship, it is advisable to find out whether or not multi-nationality is permitted in the country where you have citizenship.
If the country in question does not allow multiple citizenship, you may lose your status as a citizen of that country when you obtain Finnish citizenship.
Multiple citizenship can be useful but also disadvantageous.
For example, you should check whether you are liable to go into military service in more than one country of citizenship or whether it is sufficient to have a certificate of completed military service from one country.
Multiple citizenship can prove useful, for example, when moving from one country to another or seeking employment.
The Finnish Immigration Service advises on questions about nationality:
Tel. 0295 419 626 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 10:00–11:00
A child’s multiple citizenship
A child can be a citizen of both Finland and another country.
This depends on whether the other country accepts the child’s multiple citizenships (monikansalaisuus).
Ask about it at your own country’s Diplomatic Mission.
Can you lose Finnish citizenship?
Finnish citizenship can be lost in the following cases:
The person is 22 or older, holds citizenship in another country and does not have adequate contact to Finland.
The person has provided false information in the citizenship application or notification.
The person has received Finnish citizenship based on the father’s nationality and the relationship of paternity is disproved.

Support for refugees
Who is a refugee?
A refugee is a person with refugee status.
This status is granted to those who gain asylum in Finland or are accepted into the country in the refugee quota.
Quota refugees
You cannot apply to become a quota refugee (kiintiöpakolainen) through Finnish officials.
Nor is it possible to suggest another person, such as a friend or a relative, as a quota refugee.
Finland accepts as quota refugees persons who are considered refugees by the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
Quota refugees are selected from among the persons proposed to Finland by the UNHCR.
Finnish authorities interview the refugees proposed by the UNHCR and, on the basis of these interviews, select the persons who will be admitted to Finland.
The interviews are performed in the refugees’ countries of residence, usually in refugee camps or the UNHCR’s premises.
For example, the following issues influence the selection of quota refugees:
a refugee requires international protection
a refugee’s human rights are not realised in the country where they are residing
a refugee is not a threat to Finland’s security
a refugee has the requirements to become integrated into Finnish society.
Some of the refugees are selected without an interview on the basis of UNHCR’s documents.
They are usually urgent cases, i.e. refugees who need asylum urgently, for example, for political or health-related reasons.
The Parliament of Finland decides how many refugees are accepted into the country.
From 2001, Finland’s refugee quota has been 750 persons per year.
The Ministry of the Interior decides on the countries from which quota refugees are accepted.
Granting refugee status to asylum seekers
You can also receive refugee status if you apply for asylum in Finland.
An asylum seeker can be granted refugee status if they have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in their native country for reasons of origin, religion, nationality, belonging to a certain social group or having a political opinion and, for this reason, are unable to return to their native country.
An asylum seeker who is not granted a refugee status can, however, receive a residence permit for Finland on some other grounds.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Coming to Finland as an asylum seeker.
Information on the selection of quota refugeesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Family reunification
The family members of a refugee can also receive a residence permit for Finland.
The law defines the eligible family members.
Only these family members can receive a residence permit based on a family tie.
In Finland, the following are considered family members:
a partner in a registered partnership
common-law husband or wife
the guardian of a child under the age of 18
In some cases, a refugee is required to have sufficient income to support his or her family members in Finland for those family members to receive a residence permit.
More information on family reunification can be found on the InfoFinland page Moving to Finland to be with a family member.
Assistance for family reunification
If you have come to Finland as a quota refugee, the Finnish Immigration Service may reimburse the costs caused by your family member’s trip to the country.
However, the costs are reimbursed only if the family tie existed before you received your first residence permit for Finland.
The travel costs of other family members will not be reimbursed.
Refugees outside the quota cannot receive compensation for the travel costs of their family members.
The Finnish Red Cross assists quota refugees in travel arrangements
The Finnish Immigration Service will only reimburse the travel expenses in the event that the family member in question travels to Finland by means organised by the Finnish Red Cross or the International Organisation for Migration.
The Finnish Red Cross assists in organising the journey of the family members of a quota refugee to Finland once the family members have been granted a residence permit.
The Red Cross also provides counselling on matters relating to the rules of family reunification and what family members need to do in order to apply for family reunification.
When the Finnish Immigration Service has made a positive decision on your application based on family ties and has resolved that the state can finance your family members’ journey, it supplies a copy of the decision to the Red Cross.
If you arrived in Finland as a quota refugee and you want the Finnish state to finance your family members’ journey, contact the Red Cross’ preparedness unit and they will begin to organise the journey.
The Finnish Red Cross cannot provide financial assistance for family members’ plane tickets or other travel costs.

Health
If you have come to Finland as a quota refugee, you have a municipality of residence in Finland and you are entitled to use public health services.
Support for refugees
Refugees and asylum seekers can find help and guidance in legal questions, for example, at the Refugee Advice Centre or Legal Aid Offices (oikeusaputoimisto).
The Refugee Advice Centre provides asylum seekers with legal aid at the initial stage of the asylum process.
It also gives general legal advice to other foreigners.
The Legal Aid Offices provide persons living in Finland with expert help in dealing with legal matters.
In managing legal matters, it is possible to get a legal adviser funded partly or completely by public funds.
The Finnish Refugee Council (Suomen Pakolaisapu ry) is an organisation that strives to promote refugees’ basic rights.
This organisation performs communication, educational and social work in Finland.
The Refugee Council helps refugees and immigrants, for example, in matters relating to integration, housing and founding their own organisations.

If you move to Finland from another EU member state, you do not usually have to pay duties or value-added tax for your removal goods, i.e. the personal property you bring with you.
Nor do you have to declare your removal goods to customs (tulli).
Please note that the exemption from duty and tax of removal goods does not concern alcohol or tobacco.
Separate restrictions apply to the import of these.

Bringing a car to Finland as removal goods
When bringing a car to Finland as removal goods, you must declare it to customs.
If you bring your car to Finland, you must register it and pay a car tax (autovero) before you can use it in traffic.
It is possible to use the car temporarily before car tax has been paid.
This requires that a commissioning notification (auton käyttöönottoilmoitus) for the car is made to the Tax Administration.
Your car must also have a motor insurance policy (liikennevakuutus) valid in Finland.
If you bring a car from outside the EEA area, you will also need a transfer permit before you can use it.
Transfer permits are granted by inspection stations and certain customs offices.
You are not allowed to use your car in Finland until you have made a commissioning notification and acquired a transfer permit.
If you have questions regarding car tax and commissioning notification, you can call the Tax Administration telephone service:

Removal companies
Some companies offering removal services also tend to removals between countries.
You can hire these companies to transport your goods from one country to another and even buy packing services and have them pack your goods.
The cost of moving depends on where you are moving from and the volume of goods you are transferring.
There can be significant differences in the services and prices of different removal companies and therefore it is a good idea to compare prices.

The InfoFinland page Unemployment benefit contains more information about who is entitled to unemployment security.
Kela manages social security services and benefits, such as the national pension, child benefit, basic unemployment security, sickness and parenthood allowance, income support and rehabilitation.
Kela also provides health care benefits paid for private health care.
The grounds for Kela benefits are defined by law.
You must apply separately to be covered by Finnish social security.
Each benefit must also be applied for separately.
When deciding on a benefit, Kela reviews the life situation of each applicant individually.
The situations in life and needs for benefit often vary greatly between applicants.
Therefore, the amounts and grounds of the benefits also vary.
Always clarify your own situation separately.

Being covered by Finnish social security
As a general rule, if you reside permanently in Finland, you are covered by Finnish social security and can receive Kela benefits.
The law defines what is meant by permanent residence.
Working in Finland can also result in your being covered by Finnish social security.
Are you covered by social security and are you entitled to benefits?
This is affected by whether you are moving to Finland
from a Nordic country,
a country belonging to the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or
The EEA countries include the EU countries, along with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
Your eligibility for social security and benefits is also affected by the capacity in which you are moving to Finland, for example:
employee or entrepreneur
student
family member
seconded employee.
Finland has made agreements regarding social security with a number of countries.
These countries are the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland), The United States, Canada and Quebec, Chile, Israel, India and Australia.
The agreements primarily apply to pensions.
Some of them also concern health care.
If you are coming from one of these countries, check with Kela whether or not these agreements affect your social security.

Moving to Finland permanently and living in Finland permanently
When you move to Finland, Kela always first assesses whether or not you are moving to the country permanently, as defined by the social security legislation.
It is good to be aware that permanent residence is defined differently between acts.
In this context, the social security legislation is covered.
If you are not deemed to be moving to Finland for permanent residence, you may still be entitled to coverage by the Finnish social security based on your work.
You may be considered to be moving to Finland permanently in the following cases, for example:
You are a returnee, i.e. you are returning to Finland from abroad.
You have an employment contract, or similar agreement, regarding work you will be conducting in Finland.
You are married to or in an otherwise close family relationship with a person who is already a permanent resident of Finland.
In addition, if you are obliged to obtain a residence permit, your permit must normally be for at least 12 months.
An overall assessment of the situation will be prepared.
Based on this, it will be considered whether or not your residence is permanent.
If you are moving to Finland temporarily, you are not entitled to Finnish social security.
For example, students are considered to reside in Finland temporarily when their only reason for being in the country is studying.
Once the decision has been made that you are a permanent resident of Finland, you will be regarded as such for as long as:
you have your primary residence and home in the country, and you spend most of your time in Finland
or
you have some other reason for your permanent residence in Finland, such as a family tie or work.
However, if you begin work in another country or go abroad for more than a year, your entitlement to Finnish social security may be terminated.
More information about these situations is available from Kela.
There are also benefits that you cannot receive if you are not, or have not previously been, a permanent resident of Finland.
For example, parents can only receive parenthood allowance if they have lived in Finland for at least 180 days directly before the child’s expected date of delivery.
If you are coming from another EU country, however, you can in some cases utilise the insurance periods you have accumulated in the other EU country.
Ask for more information at Kela.

Working entitles you to at least partial coverage by Finnish social security
EU countries, EEA countries and Switzerland
If you are moving to Finland for work from within the European Union, an EEA country or Switzerland, you are normally entitled to coverage by Finnish social security for the duration of your employment, even if you have a short employment contract.
Examples:
If you are coming to work for less than four months, you may be entitled to home-care allowance and public health care.
If your employment lasts four months or longer, you will be covered by Finnish social security for the duration of your employment.
Other countries
If you are coming to Finland for work from a country other than Switzerland outside the EU or EEA region, the following factors affect your social security:
The length of your employment
The country from which you are moving to Finland
The majority of Kela benefits require you to move to Finland permanently to be entitled to them, or to have an employment relationship which lasts at least four months.
In addition, you must meet the same requirements for benefits as other residents of Finland.
If you are not moving to Finland permanently, you are normally covered by Finnish social security for the duration of your employment.
Your employment must last at least four months and your working hours and salary must be sufficient.
In addition, you must have a residence permit which includes the right to work.
The minimum requirement for working hours is usually 18 hours a week.
The salary must be accordant with the collective agreement, or if one is not available for the field, at least €1,211 per month (2019 level).

Asylum seeker
Asylum seekers are not entitled to social security in Finland.
This means that they cannot obtain social security benefits from Kela.
The reception centre pays asylum seekers a reception allowance.
The allowance is paid until the asylum application has been processed.
The reception allowance is a small amount of money intended for necessary expenses.
Asylum seekers who are granted a residence permit and who live permanently in Finland are entitled to social security in Finland.
Persons who have been granted a residence permit can apply for coverage under the Finnish social security system from Kela.

At the Local Register Office (maistraatti) of your place of residence, you can find out if you are entitled to a municipality of residence in Finland.
How to obtain a municipality of residence in Finland
In order to have a municipality of residence in Finland, you must move to Finland permanently.
If you are residing in Finland temporarily, for example to work or study for no longer than one year, in most cases you are not entitled to register a municipality of residence in Finland.

you are a Finnish citizen
you are a citizen of a Nordic country
you are a resident of an EU country, Switzerland or Lichtenstein and have registered your right of residence in Finland
you have a valid permanent (P) or continuous (A) residence permit
you are a family member of a person who has a municipality of residence in Finland

you have a job in Finland and your employment contract is valid for at least two years
you are studying in Finland and your studies will take at least two years
you are of Finnish origin

Health
Health care for employees and entrepreneurs
If you have come to Finland to work, you may be entitled to use public health services in Finland.
This depends on the duration and type of your contract of employment, as well as on the country from which you have come to Finland.
You can ask Kela to determine whether you are entitled to public health services.
More information on public health care can be found on the InfoFinland web page Health services in Finland.
In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
Entrepreneurs can organise occupational health care for themselves, if they wish.
In other words, entrepreneurs are not under an obligation to arrange occupational health care for themselves.
An entrepreneur is, however, required to organise occupational health care for any employees working for them.
Occupational health care can be arranged at a local health centre or, for example, private clinic.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Occupational health care and on the website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

If you lose your job
If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
Problems in working life
If you face problems at your workplace, contact your supervisor first.
If the issue cannot be resolved at the workplace, contact your local occupational safety district or your trade union.
Information and instructions on how to get help for various problems in working life can be found on the InfoFinland page Problems in working life.
When you have moved to Finland, you must visit the Local Register Office (maistraatti) of your place of residence to register as a resident.
Before visiting the Local Register Office, you can fill in the Registration Information of a Foreigner form on the maistraatti.fi website.
You can also fill in the form at the Local Register Office.
The Local Register Office will enter your basic data into the Finnish Population Information System.
Such information includes your name, date of birth, citizenship, sex and address.
If you move to live permanently in Finland for a year or more, you may have the right to a municipality of residence in Finland.
You need a municipality of residence to use city or municipal services, such as health care and children’s day care.
The Local Register Office decides whether a Finnish municipality of residence (kotikunta) can be entered for you.
When visiting the Local Register Office, please bring along at least the following documents:
If you are an EU or Nordic citizen:
a valid passport or other identity document indicating your citizenship
an employment contract, a certificate of studies or another proof of the need to register (if you are an EU citizen and have not yet registered your right of residence at the Immigration Service)
the original marriage certificate (if you are married)
the original birth certificates of your children (if you have children under 18 years old who are moving to Finland)
Please note that you need to legalise any documents provided by parties other than EU or Nordic authorities.
For example, if your marriage certificate was issued in the Unites States.
If you are a citizen of another country:
a valid passport
a residence permit (if you need a residence permit for Finland)
if necessary, proof of work or studies in Finland (such as an employment contract or certificate of attendance from your educational institute) or another account of the reasons for registering
the original legalised marriage certificate (if you are married)
the original legalised birth certificates of your children (if you have children under 18 years of age who are moving to Finland)
Legalising a document
You need to provide the Local Registry Office with the original document or a copy that has been reliably certified as a true copy.
A copy can be reliably certified as a true copy by the authority that issued the document or by a public notary of the same country.
The document must be legalised or the Local Registry Office cannot enter your information in the Population Information System.
If your country has joined the Hague Convention, you need to get an Apostille certificate for your document.
You do not need an Apostille certificate if you have a public document issued by an authority of an EU country.
However, you may need to fill in a standard form used for translation aid and submit it with the public document.
For more details about such standard forms, contact the authorities of the country from which you apply for the certificate.
Another option is to have the document translated by an authorised translator who has been approved by an EU country.
Please note that documents must be in Finnish, Swedish or English.
If your document is in another language, you must have it translated into Finnish, Swedish or English.
The document can be translated by an authorised translator.
If the translation is done abroad, the translation must also be legalised.
For more information on how to legalise documents, please contact the Local Register Office or the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of your own country.
Finnish personal identity code
You will receive a personal identity code from the Immigration Service when you are granted a residence permit for Finland or when your EU citizen’s right of residence is registered.

Office if you need a personal identity code for tax purposes
A Finnish personal identity code (henkilötunnus) is a number sequence with 11 characters, formed on the basis of your date of birth and gender.
You need a personal identity code for your employer or educational institution, for example.
It will also make it easier for you to attend to issues involving the authorities.
If you received your personal identity code through an authority other than the Local Registry Office and you want a municipality of residence, you need to visit the Local Registry Office.

If you need to deal with Finnish authorities and you do not speak Finnish or Swedish and have no other common language with the authority, you are sometimes entitled to interpreting services.
In these cases, the authorities will book you an interpreter and pay for the services.
Authorities can arrange and pay for interpretation when the processing of the matter in question has been initiated by the said authorities.
However, this is not always possible.
If you need an interpreter for the initial assessment and integration plan, it is the responsibility of the authority to book one.
You can ask about the matter from the authorities in advance.
If you are seeking asylum in Finland, you are entitled to interpretation in matters related to the processing of your asylum application.
You are entitled to receive information about decisions concerning you in your native language or a language that you understand.
Information on decisions is provided through interpretation or translation.
If you book and pay for an interpreter yourself, you can use an interpreter whenever you want.
Interpreter servicesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
What does an interpreter do?
An interpreter will accompany you to meetings with authorities.
He or she will interpret the discussion between you and the authority.
The interpreter will either be present or the interpretation services will be provided via a telephone or video connection.
The task of the interpreter is to interpret the discussion between you and the authority.
The interpreter will not handle any tasks other than interpretation.
Therefore, he or she cannot assist you in any other matters.
The interpreter is an impartial third party; he or she will not take your or the authority’s side.
Interpreters are sworn to secrecy, which means that they cannot disclose information about your affairs to others.
Where to book an interpreter?
There are eight interpreting centres (tulkkikeskus) in Finland, which are maintained by municipalities.
The services of interpreting centres are primarily intended for authorities that work with immigrants.
Many companies also provide interpretation services.

Bank account
You need a bank account in order to handle your finances.
It’s a good idea to compare the services and prices of different banks so that you will find the most advantageous option for you.
When opening a bank account, you need a passport, identity card for foreign citizens or some other official identity card.
If you do not have a passport or identity card for foreign citizens, it is a good idea to check what kind of proof of identity the bank accepts.
Some banks accept an alien's passport granted by a Finnish authority, a refugee travel document or other proof of identity which can be accepted as travel document.
In some cases, the bank may also require other proof of identity if your document states that your identity could not be verified.
You cannot prove your identity with a driving licence.
According to law, when you open a bank account, the bank must ask you to clarify for what purpose you intend to use your bank account.
The bank also has the right to check your credit history.
The bank needs the following information from you:
personal identity code
address in Finland or abroad
if you pay taxes to a country other than Finland, your address in that other country
the same information on persons entitled to use the bank account.
It is a good idea to also acquire online banking credentials when opening a bank account.
With online banking credentials you can, for example, attend to many official matters online.
However, the requirements for obtaining online banking credentials are stricter than those for opening a bank account.
Thus, in some cases, you cannot get online banking credentials even if you have a bank account.
If you want to ask for advice on banking matters, you can call the Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau (FINE).
The service is free of charge, in other words, you only pay the price of the phone call.
The service is available in Finnish, Swedish and English.

Other requirements that must be met:
you have a valid residence permit or residence card, or your right to reside has been registered;
you have a municipality of residence in Finland;
your information has been saved in the Finnish Population Information System.

Please note that the list does not necessarily include all of the things you must take care of when moving to Finland.
Before moving to Finland
Residence permit or registration of right of residence?
If you are coming to Finland for more than 90 days and you are an EU citizen, you must register your right of residence.
If you are a citizen of some other country, you must apply for a residence permit in Finland.
Depending on your citizenship, read more on the InfoFinland page EU citizens or Non-EU citizens.
When applying for a residence permit or registration of right of residence, you must be able to prove that your livelihood in Finland is ensured.
If you come to Finland to work or to engage in entrepreneurship, you must prove that your work or business provides you with an adequate income.
If you are moving to Finland to live with a family member, the person living in Finland is often also required to have sufficient resources to support him/herself and the family member moving to Finland.
Removal goods from the EU area
If you move to Finland from another EU member state, you do not usually have to pay duties or value-added tax for your removal goods, i.e. the personal property you bring with you.
Nor do you have to declare your removal goods to customs (tulli).
Please note that the exemption from duty and tax of removal goods does not concern alcohol or tobacco.
Separate restrictions apply to the import of these.
For more information, contact the Customs Information Service at +358 (0)295 5201 or go to the Finnish Custom’s website.

Removal goods from outside the EU
If you move to Finland from outside the EU, you do not usually have to pay duties or value-added tax for your removal goods, i.e. the personal property you bring with you.
However, you do have to declare your removal goods to the customs authorities in Finland.
For example, the following are regarded as removal goods:
furniture and other domestic goods
pets
bicycles and motorcycles
cars and trailers intended for private use
Please note that the exemption from duty and tax of removal goods doesn’t concern alcohol or tobacco.
Separate restrictions apply to the import of these.

Bringing a car to Finland as removal goods
When bringing a car to Finland as removal goods, you must declare it to customs.
If you bring your car to Finland, you must register it and pay a car tax (autovero) before you can use it in traffic.
It is possible to use the car temporarily before car tax has been paid.
This requires that a commissioning notification (auton käyttöönottoilmoitus) for the car is made to the Tax Administration.
Your car must also have a motor insurance policy (liikennevakuutus) valid in Finland.
If you bring a car from outside the EEA area, you will also need a transfer permit before you can use it.
Transfer permits are granted by inspection stations and certain customs offices.
You are not allowed to use your car in Finland until you have made a commissioning notification and acquired a transfer permit.
If you have questions regarding car tax and commissioning notification, you can call the Tax Administration telephone service:
+358 (0)29 497 150 (Finnish)

Removal companies
Some companies offering removal services also tend to removals between countries.
You can hire these companies to transport your goods from one country to another and even buy packing services and have them pack your goods.
The cost of moving depends on where you are moving from and the volume of goods you are transferring.
There can be significant differences in the services and prices of different removal companies and therefore it is a good idea to compare prices.

All immigrants are entitled to receive basic information about Finland.
Upon receiving a residence permit or registering your right to reside in the country, you are provided with written information concerning
Finnish society and working life,
your rights and obligations, and
services that can assist your integration.

They can help you to integrate into Finnish society.
integration and related services
working life
education and studying.
Initial assessment
The purpose of the initial assessment is to assess the services you need to support your integration.
The initial assessment collects information on your education, work experience and language skills, for example.
The initial assessment is conducted at an Employment and Economic Development Office (työ- ja elinkeinotoimisto) or in your municipality.
The assessment can also be conducted in another location, such as an educational institute.
This depends on how the initial assessment has been organised in your municipality of residence.
You can request the initial assessment from the Employment and Economic Development Office or your local Social Office, for example.
Immigrant advisors can provide more information on the initial assessment and how it is organised in your municipality of residence.
If you require support for integration, an integration plan will be prepared for you after the initial assessment.
The integration plan is always prepared if you
are an unemployed job seeker, or
you receive income support, or
you are under 18 years old and do not have a guardian in Finland.
An integration plan is a plan detailing measures that will aid your integration.
The integration plan can include Finnish language studies, other education or practical training, for example.
You can prepare the plan together with a job counsellor at an Employment and Economic Development Office or TE office (TE toimisto) or with a social worker at a Social Office.
The integration plan must be made no later than three years after you receive your first residence permit or your right of residence has been registered.
The duration of the plan depends on how long you require support for integration.
Normally, the maximum duration for an integration plan is three years.
In some special cases, the plan can be extended to five years.
Once your integration plan has been prepared, it is important that you adhere to it.
Your TE office or municipality will guide you to integration training, if necessary.
The training usually includes Finnish or Swedish language studies as well as an introduction to Finnish society, culture and working life.
In addition, the training may include other education or practical training.
The TE office, Kela or municipality will determine your right to receive unemployment benefit or income support for the time of your integration plan.
If you have a job, your employer can sometimes help you in the integration process.
For example, the employer can pay for your Finnish language course, for example.
Employers can also sometimes help you to take care of various practical things, such as obtaining housing.
For more information, ask your employer.

Municipalities offer their residents a range of services.
For example, municipal services include health care and day care for children.
If you have a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland, in most cases you are entitled to use the services provided by the municipality.
You should find out if you and your family members are entitled to a municipality of residence in Finland.
In Finland, the right to a municipality of residence is determined by the Municipality of Residence Act.
At the Local Register Office (maistraatti) of your place of residence, you can find out if you are entitled to a municipality of residence in Finland.
How to obtain a municipality of residence in Finland
In order to have a municipality of residence in Finland, you must move to Finland permanently.
If you are residing in Finland temporarily, for example to work or study for no longer than one year, in most cases you are not entitled to register a municipality of residence in Finland.
Your municipality of residence can be in Finland if:
you are a Finnish citizen
you are a citizen of a Nordic country
you are a resident of an EU country, Switzerland or Lichtenstein and have registered your right of residence in Finland
you have a valid permanent (P) or continuous (A) residence permit
you are a family member of a person who has a municipality of residence in Finland
If you have a valid temporary residence permit (B), you may have a Finnish municipality of residence, but only if you can demonstrate that you intend to live in Finland permanently.
The following factors among others can demonstrate permanent residence:
you have a job in Finland and your employment contract is valid for at least two years
you are studying in Finland and your studies will take at least two years
you are of Finnish origin
you have previously had a municipality of residence in Finland
you have continuously resided in Finland for at least one year
Your municipality of residence is usually the municipality in which you live.
If you have no accommodation or have accommodation in several municipalities, your municipality of residence is the municipality you yourself consider your municipality of residence and to which you have a close connection, for example through your family ties or job.

If your marriage or registered partnership ends
If you lose your job
Cancellation of residence permit
Your permanent or fixed-term residence permit will be cancelled if
you move away from Finland permanently,
you continuously reside abroad for two years.
Your permanent or fixed-term residence permit can also be cancelled if
you provided incorrect information when applying for the permit,
you withheld a factor that could have prevented you from receiving the permit, or
another Schengen country requests Finland to revoke your residence permit.
A fixed-term residence permit can also be revoked if the grounds on which it was granted no longer exist.
The decisions regarding residence permit cancellations are made by the Finnish Immigration Service.
If you move abroad
If you intend to move away from Finland for two years due to, for example, work or studies, you can submit an application to the Finnish Immigration Service to prevent the cancellation of your residence permit.
The application can be free form but must include the date, along with your signature and personal information.
It must also indicate the duration of and reason for your stay abroad.
In addition, it must include justification for why your residence permit should not be cancelled.
You must submit the application before residing abroad for two years.
If your Finnish employer has assigned you to work abroad, you will not lose your residence permit for Finland even if your work forces you to reside abroad for more than two years.
If your marriage or registered partnership ends
If you have a fixed-term residence permit based on family ties, the end of your marriage or registered partnership may affect your residence permit.
If the family tie no longer exists, a residence permit granted on that basis will not necessarily be extended.
It is also possible that your residence permit currently in force will be cancelled.
However, your residence permit can be extended if you continue to have strong ties to Finland.
Examples of such strong ties include:
children or other family members in Finland
a job or a business in Finland
a student position in Finland.
If you divorce your spouse because of his or her violent behaviour towards you, your residence permit can be extended despite the divorce.
You should present a clarifying document, such as a doctor’s certificate or a statement from a family counselling centre.
You should also attach your account of the circumstances to the residence permit application.
More information on divorce and the termination of a registered partnership is available on the InfoFinland page Divorce.
If you lose your job
If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
More information on working and running a business in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Employment and entrepreneurship.
Information on residence permits for employees and entrepreneurs can be found on the pages Work in Finland and Moving to Finland as an entrepreneur.
If you already have a residence permit in Finland but are not granted a residence permit extension, the Finnish Immigration Service makes a deportation decision.
If you commit crimes in Finland, you can also be deported based on the crimes.
If you are deported, any valid residence permit that you have will become void and you must leave the country.
You will usually be given a deadline by which you must leave Finland.
If you do not leave Finland before the deadline, the police or Border Guard will remove you from the country.
According to the law, you will not be deported if you are in danger of the death penalty, torture, persecution or other inhumane or degrading treatment in your home country.

Who is an asylum seeker?
An asylum seeker is a person who seeks protection and right of residence in a different country.
International protection can be given to a person who has a justified reason to fear persecution (due to origin, religion, nationality, membership in a specific group or political opinion) or who would otherwise be in real danger in their home country or country of permanent residence.
This means that an asylum seeker is not a refugee.
If an asylum seeker is granted refugee status or a residence permit based on protection or on other grounds, they can stay in Finland.

An asylum seeker's right of residence
You can stay in Finland if you are granted asylum or a residence permit on other grounds.
If the conditions in your home country are such that you do not need asylum and there are no other grounds for granting a residence permit, your application will be rejected, and you will be expelled from Finland.
If your asylum application or residence permit application is rejected, you can appeal the decision.

Support for refugees
Who is a refugee?
A refugee is a person with refugee status.
This status is granted to those who gain asylum in Finland or are accepted into the country in the refugee quota.
Quota refugees
You cannot apply to become a quota refugee (kiintiöpakolainen) through Finnish officials.
Nor is it possible to suggest another person, such as a friend or a relative, as a quota refugee.
Finland accepts as quota refugees persons who are considered refugees by the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
Quota refugees are selected from among the persons proposed to Finland by the UNHCR.
Finnish authorities interview the refugees proposed by the UNHCR and, on the basis of these interviews, select the persons who will be admitted to Finland.
The interviews are performed in the refugees’ countries of residence, usually in refugee camps or the UNHCR’s premises.
For example, the following issues influence the selection of quota refugees:
a refugee requires international protection
a refugee’s human rights are not realised in the country where they are residing
a refugee is not a threat to Finland’s security
a refugee has the requirements to become integrated into Finnish society.
Some of the refugees are selected without an interview on the basis of UNHCR’s documents.
They are usually urgent cases, i.e. refugees who need asylum urgently, for example, for political or health-related reasons.
The Parliament of Finland decides how many refugees are accepted into the country.
From 2001, Finland’s refugee quota has been 750 persons per year.
The Ministry of the Interior decides on the countries from which quota refugees are accepted.
Granting refugee status to asylum seekers
You can also receive refugee status if you apply for asylum in Finland.
An asylum seeker can be granted refugee status if they have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in their native country for reasons of origin, religion, nationality, belonging to a certain social group or having a political opinion and, for this reason, are unable to return to their native country.
An asylum seeker who is not granted a refugee status can, however, receive a residence permit for Finland on some other grounds.
Read more on the InfoFinland web page Coming to Finland as an asylum seeker.
Information on the selection of quota refugeesFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Family reunification
The family members of a refugee can also receive a residence permit for Finland.
The law defines the eligible family members.
Only these family members can receive a residence permit based on a family tie.
In Finland, the following are considered family members:
a partner in a registered partnership
common-law husband or wife
the guardian of a child under the age of 18
In some cases, a refugee is required to have sufficient income to support his or her family members in Finland for those family members to receive a residence permit.
More information on family reunification can be found on the InfoFinland page Moving to Finland to be with a family member.
Assistance for family reunification
If you have come to Finland as a quota refugee, the Finnish Immigration Service may reimburse the costs caused by your family member’s trip to the country.
However, the costs are reimbursed only if the family tie existed before you received your first residence permit for Finland.
The travel costs of other family members will not be reimbursed.
Refugees outside the quota cannot receive compensation for the travel costs of their family members.
The Finnish Red Cross assists quota refugees in travel arrangements
The Finnish Immigration Service will only reimburse the travel expenses in the event that the family member in question travels to Finland by means organised by the Finnish Red Cross or the International Organisation for Migration.
The Finnish Red Cross assists in organising the journey of the family members of a quota refugee to Finland once the family members have been granted a residence permit.
The Red Cross also provides counselling on matters relating to the rules of family reunification and what family members need to do in order to apply for family reunification.
When the Finnish Immigration Service has made a positive decision on your application based on family ties and has resolved that the state can finance your family members’ journey, it supplies a copy of the decision to the Red Cross.
If you arrived in Finland as a quota refugee and you want the Finnish state to finance your family members’ journey, contact the Red Cross’ preparedness unit and they will begin to organise the journey.
The Finnish Red Cross cannot provide financial assistance for family members’ plane tickets or other travel costs.

Cancellation of residence permit
Your permanent or fixed-term residence permit will be cancelled if
you move away from Finland permanently,
you continuously reside abroad for two years.
Your permanent or fixed-term residence permit can also be cancelled if
you provided incorrect information when applying for the permit,
you withheld a factor that could have prevented you from receiving the permit, or
another Schengen country requests Finland to revoke your residence permit.
A fixed-term residence permit can also be revoked if the grounds on which it was granted no longer exist.
The decisions regarding residence permit cancellations are made by the Finnish Immigration Service.
If you move abroad
If you intend to move away from Finland for two years due to, for example, work or studies, you can submit an application to the Finnish Immigration Service to prevent the cancellation of your residence permit.
The application can be free form but must include the date, along with your signature and personal information.
It must also indicate the duration of and reason for your stay abroad.
In addition, it must include justification for why your residence permit should not be cancelled.
You must submit the application before residing abroad for two years.
If your Finnish employer has assigned you to work abroad, you will not lose your residence permit for Finland even if your work forces you to reside abroad for more than two years.
If your marriage or registered partnership ends
If you have a fixed-term residence permit based on family ties, the end of your marriage or registered partnership may affect your residence permit.
If the family tie no longer exists, a residence permit granted on that basis will not necessarily be extended.
It is also possible that your residence permit currently in force will be cancelled.
However, your residence permit can be extended if you continue to have strong ties to Finland.
Examples of such strong ties include:
children or other family members in Finland
a job or a business in Finland
a student position in Finland.
If you divorce your spouse because of his or her violent behaviour towards you, your residence permit can be extended despite the divorce.
You should present a clarifying document, such as a doctor’s certificate or a statement from a family counselling centre.
You should also attach your account of the circumstances to the residence permit application.
More information on divorce and the termination of a registered partnership is available on the InfoFinland page Divorce.
If you lose your job
If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
More information on working and running a business in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Employment and entrepreneurship.
Information on residence permits for employees and entrepreneurs can be found on the pages Work in Finland and Moving to Finland as an entrepreneur.
If you already have a residence permit in Finland but are not granted a residence permit extension, the Finnish Immigration Service makes a deportation decision.
If you commit crimes in Finland, you can also be deported based on the crimes.
If you are deported, any valid residence permit that you have will become void and you must leave the country.
You will usually be given a deadline by which you must leave Finland.
If you do not leave Finland before the deadline, the police or Border Guard will remove you from the country.
According to the law, you will not be deported if you are in danger of the death penalty, torture, persecution or other inhumane or degrading treatment in your home country.

If you have a fixed-term residence permit (A or B permit) and the reason for your stay in Finland changes, you must apply for a new residence permit on new grounds.
If you have a permanent residence permit (P) in Finland, you do not need to change the grounds for your permit even when the reason for your stay changes.
A residence permit can be applied for on one of the following grounds:
Working
Studies
Family ties
Remigration
Finnish heritage
International protection
Other reason
You should bear in mind that the grounds for a residence permit can affect your rights in Finland.
For example, a residence permit granted based on a family tie includes a more extensive right to work than a permit granted based on studies.
How to change a temporary residence permit into a continuous one?
If you have a temporary residence permit (B permit), you can apply for a continuous permit (A permit) if the reason for your stay in Finland changes from temporary to continuous.
If you have been granted a temporary residence permit based on a family tie, you can apply for a continuous residence permit when the family member in question applies for one.
You can also apply for a continuous permit on other grounds if they are continuous.
If you have a temporary residence permit based on studies, you can only receive a continuous permit if the basis for your stay in Finland changes.
It is not possible to obtain a continuous permit based on studies.
The grounds for your stay can change, for example, if you obtain a job in Finland or marry a Finnish citizen or a person with a permanent or continuous residence permit for Finland.
If you have a temporary residence permit for the purpose of working or entrepreneurial activities, you can apply for a continuous residence permit when you have resided in Finland for a continuous period of two years.
How do I apply for residence permit on new grounds?
Choose the application form based on the grounds under which you are applying for a new permit.
Submit your application online in the Enter Finland service or at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service.

Once you complete your studies and your student residence permit ends, you can apply for a permit extension (jatkolupa) for job application.
The permit is valid for 12 months.
The permit can only be granted once and cannot be renewed.
Once you find a job, you can apply for a residence permit based on employment.

Social security
If you are moving to Finland for work from within the European Union, an EEA country or Switzerland, you are normally entitled to partial coverage by Finnish social security, even when you have a short employment contract.
If you are coming to Finland for work from a country other than Switzerland outside the EU or EEA region, the following factors affect your social security:
The length of your employment
The country from which you are moving to Finland
The majority of Kela benefits require you to move to Finland permanently to be entitled to them.
In addition, you must meet the same requirements for benefits as other residents of Finland.
Even if you are not moving to Finland permanently, you can, in some cases, be entitled to partial coverage by Finnish social security for the duration of your employment.
The requirement is that your working hours and salary are sufficient.
If you work in Finland, it is recommended to become a member of a Finnish unemployment fund.
If you are a member of an unemployment fund, you can receive earnings-related daily unemployment allowance, if you become unemployed.

In Finland, employers have a duty to pay for preventive health care for their employees.
Entrepreneurs can organise occupational health care for themselves, if they wish.
In other words, entrepreneurs are not under an obligation to arrange occupational health care for themselves.
An entrepreneur is, however, required to organise occupational health care for any employees working for them.
Occupational health care can be arranged at a local health centre or, for example, private clinic.
You can find more information on the InfoFinland web page Occupational health care and on the website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

If you lose your job
If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
Problems in working life
If you face problems at your workplace, contact your supervisor first.
If the issue cannot be resolved at the workplace, contact your local occupational safety district or your trade union.
Information and instructions on how to get help for various problems in working life can be found on the InfoFinland page Problems in working life.
If you are in Finland and receive a negative residence permit decision from the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto), you must either leave Finland or appeal against the decision.
You may stay in Finland for as long as it takes to process your appeal.
You can also file an appeal if you have applied for a residence permit from abroad.
In that case, you must wait abroad for the processing of the appeal.
If you are in Finland as an asylum seeker or are a victim of human trafficking, you are entitled to receive assistance for voluntary return (vapaaehtoisen paluun tuki) if you decide to return to your home country.
Read more under Assistance for voluntary return.
Appealing against a residence permit decision
Instructions for filing an appeal are always enclosed with the decision.
The appeal will be processed by the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus).
The Administrative Court may either reject the appeal or return the matter to the Finnish Immigration Service for reprocessing.
If the appeal is rejected, the Finnish Immigration Service’s decision remains in force.
If the appeal is rejected by the Administrative Court, you may in some cases apply for permission to appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus).
If the Supreme Administrative Court grants you permission to appeal, it will process your appeal.
You may receive help for filing an appeal from a private lawyer, State Legal Aid Offices (valtion oikeusaputoimisto) or the Refugee Advice Centre (Pakolaisneuvonta) (asylum seekers only).

Finland is a part of the Schengen area.
Countries belonging to the Schengen area have analogous visa requirements.
Foreigners who want to travel to Finland for a short period of time, for example, to take a holiday, make a business trip or visit their relatives, will need a visa unless they are citizens of a visa-exempt country.
A visa is an entry permit for a short-term and temporary stay, lasting no more than three months.
You can visit the website of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland or a Finnish Diplomatic Mission nearest to you, to find out whether you need a visa to travel to Finland or another country in the Schengen area.

You can stay in Finland or another country in the Schengen area without a residence permit for the length of your visa’s validity.

How to apply for a Schengen visa
Apply for a visa at the nearest Finnish Diplomatic Mission or visa application centre.
You must be legally residing in the country in which you are applying for a visa.

Before moving to Finland
Residence permit or registration of right of residence?
If you are coming to Finland for more than 90 days and you are an EU citizen, you must register your right of residence.

If you are moving to Finland to live with a family member, the person living in Finland is often also required to have sufficient resources to support him/herself and the family member moving to Finland.
Removal goods from the EU area
If you move to Finland from another EU member state, you do not usually have to pay duties or value-added tax for your removal goods, i.e. the personal property you bring with you.
Nor do you have to declare your removal goods to customs (tulli).
Please note that the exemption from duty and tax of removal goods does not concern alcohol or tobacco.
Separate restrictions apply to the import of these.
For more information, contact the Customs Information Service at +358 (0)295 5201 or go to the Finnish Custom’s website.

For example, the following are regarded as removal goods:
furniture and other domestic goods
pets

Bringing a car to Finland as removal goods
When bringing a car to Finland as removal goods, you must declare it to customs.
If you bring your car to Finland, you must register it and pay a car tax (autovero) before you can use it in traffic.
It is possible to use the car temporarily before car tax has been paid.
This requires that a commissioning notification (auton käyttöönottoilmoitus) for the car is made to the Tax Administration.
Your car must also have a motor insurance policy (liikennevakuutus) valid in Finland.
If you bring a car from outside the EEA area, you will also need a transfer permit before you can use it.
Transfer permits are granted by inspection stations and certain customs offices.
You are not allowed to use your car in Finland until you have made a commissioning notification and acquired a transfer permit.

Removal companies
Some companies offering removal services also tend to removals between countries.
You can hire these companies to transport your goods from one country to another and even buy packing services and have them pack your goods.
The cost of moving depends on where you are moving from and the volume of goods you are transferring.
There can be significant differences in the services and prices of different removal companies and therefore it is a good idea to compare prices.

Municipalities offer their residents a range of services.
For example, municipal services include health care and day care for children.
If you have a municipality of residence (kotikunta) in Finland, in most cases you are entitled to use the services provided by the municipality.
You should find out if you and your family members are entitled to a municipality of residence in Finland.
In Finland, the right to a municipality of residence is determined by the Municipality of Residence Act.
At the Local Register Office (maistraatti) of your place of residence, you can find out if you are entitled to a municipality of residence in Finland.
How to obtain a municipality of residence in Finland
In order to have a municipality of residence in Finland, you must move to Finland permanently.
If you are residing in Finland temporarily, for example to work or study for no longer than one year, in most cases you are not entitled to register a municipality of residence in Finland.
Your municipality of residence can be in Finland if:
you are a Finnish citizen
you are a citizen of a Nordic country
you are a resident of an EU country, Switzerland or Lichtenstein and have registered your right of residence in Finland
you have a valid permanent (P) or continuous (A) residence permit
you are a family member of a person who has a municipality of residence in Finland

you have a job in Finland and your employment contract is valid for at least two years
you are studying in Finland and your studies will take at least two years
you are of Finnish origin
you have previously had a municipality of residence in Finland
you have continuously resided in Finland for at least one year

If you have a fixed-term residence permit (A or B permit) and the reason for your stay in Finland changes, you must apply for a new residence permit on new grounds.
If you have a permanent residence permit (P) in Finland, you do not need to change the grounds for your permit even when the reason for your stay changes.
A residence permit can be applied for on one of the following grounds:
Working
Studies
Family ties
Remigration
Finnish heritage
International protection
Other reason
You should bear in mind that the grounds for a residence permit can affect your rights in Finland.
For example, a residence permit granted based on a family tie includes a more extensive right to work than a permit granted based on studies.
How to change a temporary residence permit into a continuous one?
If you have a temporary residence permit (B permit), you can apply for a continuous permit (A permit) if the reason for your stay in Finland changes from temporary to continuous.
If you have been granted a temporary residence permit based on a family tie, you can apply for a continuous residence permit when the family member in question applies for one.
You can also apply for a continuous permit on other grounds if they are continuous.
If you have a temporary residence permit based on studies, you can only receive a continuous permit if the basis for your stay in Finland changes.
It is not possible to obtain a continuous permit based on studies.
The grounds for your stay can change, for example, if you obtain a job in Finland or marry a Finnish citizen or a person with a permanent or continuous residence permit for Finland.
If you have a temporary residence permit for the purpose of working or entrepreneurial activities, you can apply for a continuous residence permit when you have resided in Finland for a continuous period of two years.
How do I apply for residence permit on new grounds?
Choose the application form based on the grounds under which you are applying for a new permit.
Submit your application online in the Enter Finland service or at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service.

Coming to Finland as a refugee
You can find more information for refugees on the InfoFinland page Refugee.
When you have moved to Finland, you must visit the Local Register Office (maistraatti) of your place of residence.
Before visiting the Local Register Office, you can fill in the registration form on the maistraatti.fi website.
You can also fill in the form at the Local Register Office.
When certain conditions are met, you can also receive a Finnish personal identity code from the Local Register Office if you did not receive one when you were granted a residence permit or when your EU citizen’s right of residence was registered at the Finnish Immigration Service.
If you need a personal identity code for work, you can get a personal identity code from a tax office as well.
The Local Register Office decides whether a Finnish municipality of residence (kotikunta) can be entered for you.
When visiting the Local Register Office, please bring along at least the following documents:
a passport or
other identity document indicating your citizenship (if you are a citizen of an EU country or the Nordic countries)
a legalised marriage certificate (if you are married),
children's legalised birth certificates (if you have children who are under 18 moving to Finland),
a residence permit (if you need a residence permit for Finland),
certificate of registration of an EU citizen’s right to reside (if you are an EU citizen and you need registration),
a contract of employment or a certificate of studies (unless you have registered your EU citizen’s right to reside)
Please note that any documents brought from abroad must be legalised in order for personal data based on them to be entered into the Population Information System.
Documents must also be translated into Finnish, Swedish or English if they are in some other language.
For further information on the legalisation of documents, please contact the Local Register Office or the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of your own country.

Finnish personal identity code
A personal identity code (henkilötunnus) is a number sequence with 11 characters, formed on the basis of your date of birth and gender.
You need a personal identity code for your employer or educational institution, for example.
It will also make it easier for you to attend to issues involving the authorities.
To obtain a Finnish personal identity code, you must register your data in the Finnish Population Information System.
This means that any basic information on you must be entered in the Population Information System.
Such information includes your name, date of birth, citizenship, gender and address.
When you apply for a residence permit, you can apply for a Finnish personal identity code at the same time.
In such a case, in your residence permit application you should request registration in the Finnish Population Information System.
If you are an EU citizen, you can apply for a personal identity code at the same time as applying for registration of your right of residence.
You can request registration in the Finnish Population Information System by ticking the appropriate box on the registration form.

Asylum seeker’s right to work
You can apply for asylum in Finland if you have a justified reason to fear persecution in your home country.
Reasons for the persecution can include origin, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinions.
The Finnish Immigration Service investigates whether there are grounds for asylum and makes the decision.
You can only apply for asylum for yourself.

Seeking asylum
You can apply for asylum in Finland only inside Finnish borders.
There is not a special asylum application form that you can submit in advance.
When you arrive in Finland, immediately tell the border control authority or police that you want to seek asylum.
The border control authority or police will register you as an asylum seeker, record your basic information and take your fingerprints.
Once an official has received your asylum application, you will be taken to a reception centre.
You can live there while the Immigration Service processes your application.
You can also live somewhere other than at the reception centre but you must pay for your housing yourself.
Seeking asylum in FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Asylum seeker from the European Union
In EU countries (and Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), you must apply for asylum in the first country that you enter.
If you applied for asylum or resided in another EU country (or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) before coming to Finland, your application will not be processed in Finland.
Instead, you will be turned back to the country you were in before coming to Finland.
This is called the Dublin procedure.
If you are a citizen of a European Union member state, you will probably not receive asylum in Finland.
Finland considers all EU countries safe for their citizens.
However, all applications of EU citizens are still investigated.
You can find information on how to move to Finland for reasons other than as an asylum seeker on the InfoFinland page EU citizens.
Leaving an asylum application unprocessedFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Unaccompanied minor asylum seeker
If you are an asylum seeker, under 18 years old and enter Finland without a parent or guardian, a representative will be appointed for you.
The representative is a trustworthy adult who manages your affairs while the Finnish Immigration Service processes your application.
The representative comes with you when you need to speak with the authorities.
Your representative also investigates whether you can be reunited with your family.
You have a right to accommodation, food and health care.
You also have a right to go to school.

Asylum application processing
The Finnish Immigration Service will process your application and make the decision.
The Finnish Immigration Service will verify your identity and the route through which you travelled to Finland and assess whether you can receive asylum in Finland.
It is common for the processing to take several months.
Once you have applied for asylum, you have the right to stay in Finland for as long as it takes to process your application.
During that time, you cannot leave the country.
If you leave the country, the authorities may decide that your application is no longer valid.
The Finnish Immigration Service will send you an invitation to an asylum interview.
The invitation will state the language to which the interview will be interpreted, the exact address of the interview location and the time and date of the interview.
Processing of asylum applicationsFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Asylum interview
The asylum interview (turvapaikkapuhuttelu) is the most important event during the processing of your application.
During the interview, you will be asked about the events and reasons why you had to leave your home country.
It is important to give as much detail as possible about what happened.
Based on what you say, the Finnish Immigration Service will decide whether you will be granted asylum in Finland.
As an asylum seeker, you have the right to have a legal aid attorney in the interview.
The attorney will participate in the asylum interview at their own discretion.
If you need an interpreter, the Finnish Immigration Service will get one for you.
Positive decision
You can stay in Finland if you are granted asylum or a residence permit on other grounds.
You can be granted asylum in Finland if the authorities think that you will be persecuted in your home country due to
origin
religion
nationality
membership in a specific social group, or
political opinion.
If you are not granted asylum, in some cases you can be granted a residence permit based on subsidiary protection.
You can be granted a residence permit based on subsidiary protection if you are at risk of:
death penalty or execution;
torture or other inhumane treatment or punishment; or
serious personal danger due to an armed conflict.
When you apply for asylum, the Finnish Immigration Service also investigates whether you could be granted a residence permit on other grounds.
AsylumFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Negative decision

Finland is a part of the Schengen area.
Countries belonging to the Schengen area have analogous visa requirements.
Foreigners who want to travel to Finland for a short period of time, for example, to take a holiday, make a business trip or visit their relatives, will need a visa unless they are citizens of a visa-exempt country.
A visa is an entry permit for a short-term and temporary stay, lasting no more than three months.
You can visit the website of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland or a Finnish Diplomatic Mission nearest to you, to find out whether you need a visa to travel to Finland or another country in the Schengen area.
linkkiMinistry for Foreign Affairs:
Visa requirement in the Schengen area and travel documents accepted by FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Information for persons who are exempt from the visa requirement
You can travel to Finland or another Schengen country if you have a valid passport or another travel document approved by the Finnish authorities.
You can stay in Finland or another country in the Schengen area for no longer than three months within a six month period, beginning from the day you arrive in the Schengen area.
Information for persons who are required to carry a visa
You must always have a visa when arriving in Finland or another country in the Schengen area.
You can stay in Finland or another country in the Schengen area without a residence permit for the length of your visa’s validity.
If you have a visa or residence permit for a Schengen country, you can travel within the Schengen area without a separate visa for the other countries in the area.
How to apply for a Schengen visa
Apply for a visa at the nearest Finnish Diplomatic Mission or visa application centre.
You must be legally residing in the country in which you are applying for a visa.
In countries that do not have a Finnish Diplomatic Mission, another country can represent Finland in matters regarding visas.
In this case, you can apply for a visa at a Diplomatic Mission of this country.
The website of the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosts a list of the countries in which another country represents Finland in matters regarding visas.
The visa must be applied for using the visa application form.
These forms are available on the website of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland and the Diplomatic Missions of Schengen countries.
The number of enclosures required for the visa application may vary depending on the country of application.
You can ask what enclosures are required for your visa application at a Diplomatic Mission.
The application must be submitted to the Finnish Diplomatic Mission or visa application centre at which you apply for the visa.
The visa application cannot be submitted by e-mail or fax.
Extending a visa in Finland
The police may extend the residence time marked in your visa or the visa’s validity, if you are unable to leave Finland for a justifiable reason when your visa expires.
Justifiable reasons for a visa extension include, for example:
unexpected serious illness that prevents travelling
the unexpected serious illness or death of a relative living in Finland
cancellation of a flight due to a strike or bad weather
the continuation of important business negotiations for a longer period than expected

Help in case of an emergency
Diplomatic missions aid the citizens of their countries who encounter emergencies in Finland.
They can assist you if you are involved in an accident, succumb to an illness or fall victim to an offence, for example.
A mission can provide you with a new passport if you have lost your passport or if it has been stolen.
If you are in Finland as a tourist and you encounter a difficult situation, contact your country’s diplomatic mission.

In some cases, a Finnish citizen's family members other than spouses, common-law spouses, parents of a minor or minors themselves may also be eligible for a residence permit in Finland based on family ties.
The permit can also be granted to other family members of a person who has a residence permit based on international protection.
If the basis of your residence permit is something other than international protection, your family members are not eligible for a residence permit.
Other family members may be eligible for a residence permit, if they are entirely dependent on the family member residing in Finland.
On this basis, a permit can be granted for example to the parents of a person who has reached the age of majority (who has turned 18).
Financial dependency alone or poor health, however, are not considered grounds for granting a residence permit.
Another family member may also be granted a residence permit if he or she has led a stable family life with a family member residing in Finland before the family member arrived in Finland.
Another requirement is that this family life was interrupted for a serious reason, such as taking refuge.

It must also indicate the duration of and reason for your stay abroad.
In addition, it must include justification for why your residence permit should not be cancelled.
You must submit the application before residing abroad for two years.
If your Finnish employer has assigned you to work abroad, you will not lose your residence permit for Finland even if your work forces you to reside abroad for more than two years.
If your marriage or registered partnership ends
If you have a fixed-term residence permit based on family ties, the end of your marriage or registered partnership may affect your residence permit.
If the family tie no longer exists, a residence permit granted on that basis will not necessarily be extended.
It is also possible that your residence permit currently in force will be cancelled.
However, your residence permit can be extended if you continue to have strong ties to Finland.
Examples of such strong ties include:
children or other family members in Finland
a job or a business in Finland
a student position in Finland.
If you divorce your spouse because of his or her violent behaviour towards you, your residence permit can be extended despite the divorce.
You should present a clarifying document, such as a doctor’s certificate or a statement from a family counselling centre.
You should also attach your account of the circumstances to the residence permit application.
More information on divorce and the termination of a registered partnership is available on the InfoFinland page Divorce.
If you lose your job
If you have a worker’s residence permit, which only applies to working for a particular employer and you lose your job, you must apply for an entirely new worker’s residence permit or base your permit application on other grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has granted you a worker’s residence permit and your employment ends before the permit, you or your employer must notify the Immigration Service in writing that employment will end.
If your worker’s residence permit has not been limited to working for a particular employer and instead applies to a specific professional field and is effective, you can switch jobs within the same field.
More information on working and running a business in Finland is available on the InfoFinland page Employment and entrepreneurship.
Information on residence permits for employees and entrepreneurs can be found on the pages Work in Finland and Moving to Finland as an entrepreneur.
If you already have a residence permit in Finland but are not granted a residence permit extension, the Finnish Immigration Service makes a deportation decision.
If you commit crimes in Finland, you can also be deported based on the crimes.
If you are deported, any valid residence permit that you have will become void and you must leave the country.
You will usually be given a deadline by which you must leave Finland.
If you do not leave Finland before the deadline, the police or Border Guard will remove you from the country.
According to the law, you will not be deported if you are in danger of the death penalty, torture, persecution or other inhumane or degrading treatment in your home country.

Quota refugees
You cannot apply to become a quota refugee (kiintiöpakolainen) through Finnish officials.
Nor is it possible to suggest another person, such as a friend or a relative, as a quota refugee.

Quota refugees are selected from among the persons proposed to Finland by the UNHCR.
Such interviews are performed in the refugees’ countries of residence, usually in refugee camps or the UNHCR’s premises.

In order to obtain a residence permit, you must have sufficient funds to secure your income.
These funds must be at your free disposal, for example in a bank account under your own name.
The income of your partner residing in Finland will not be considered.

In EU countries (and Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), you must apply for asylum in the first country that you enter.

death penalty or execution;
torture or other inhumane treatment or punishment; or
serious personal danger due to an armed conflict.
When you apply for asylum, the Finnish Immigration Service also investigates whether you could be granted a residence permit on other grounds.

If you want to move to Finland to live with a member of your family who is already residing in this country, you will require a residence permit.
If you would only like to visit a family member in Finland, see further information on the InfoFinland page A short stay in Finland.
Not all of your family members can be granted a residence permit.
Normally, a residence permit can be granted to the spouse, common-law spouse or minor children of a person residing in Finland, and to the parents of a minor child residing in Finland.
Often it is also required that the person residing in Finland has adequate funds to support the family member moving to Finland.
Please note that different rules apply to the family members of EU citizens (non-Finnish citizens).
If you are a family member of an EU citizen residing in Finland, you can find additional information on residence permits on the InfoFinland page EU citizens.

Legal adviceFinnish _ English _ French _ Arabic
In some cases, a Finnish citizen's family members other than spouses, common-law spouses, parents of a minor or minors themselves may also be eligible for a residence permit in Finland based on family ties.
The permit can also be granted to other family members of a person who has a residence permit based on international protection.
If the basis of your residence permit is something other than international protection, your family members are not eligible for a residence permit.
Other family members may be eligible for a residence permit, if they are entirely dependent on the family member residing in Finland.
On this basis, a permit can be granted for example to the parents of a person who has reached the age of majority (who has turned 18).
Financial dependency alone or poor health, however, are not considered grounds for granting a residence permit.
Another family member may also be granted a residence permit if he or she has led a stable family life with a family member residing in Finland before the family member arrived in Finland.
Another requirement is that this family life was interrupted for a serious reason, such as taking refuge.

Applying for a residence permit
Being an entrepreneur in Finland
In Finland, anyone with a permanent residence in a country belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA) can start a business.
The need for a permit is not dependent on nationality but instead your place of residence.
If you are a citizen of an EU country, EEA country, Nordic country or Switzerland and wish to move to Finland to start a business, you do not require a residence permit.
Read more on the InfoFinland page EU citizens.
If you do not live in the EEA area and are a citizen of a country other than a Member State of the European Union, an EEA country or Switzerland, you will need a residence permit to become an entrepreneur in Finland.
Your business operations must be profitable, and your livelihood must be ensured by earnings from these activities.
You must apply for the first residence permit before you come to Finland.
Entrepreneur’s residence permit
If you want to work as an entrepreneur in Finland, you will need an entrepreneur’s residence permit.
The following are regarded as entrepreneurs:
start-up entrepreneur
sole proprietor, an individually-owned business
partner in a general partnership
active partner in a limited partnership
member of a cooperative who has an unlimited obligation to contribute
partner in an executive position in a limited company (managing director or board member) or some other corporation
In order to be eligible for a residence permit, you must personally work at your company in Finland.
If you do not have a permanent residence in Finland or elsewhere in the EEA area, you must register your business operations in the Trade Register of the Finnish Patent and Registration Office before applying for an entrepreneur’s residence permit.
If you move to Finland or the EEA area permanently, you will not require permission from the Finnish Patent and Registration Office to set up a business.
In other words, the permit is not dependent on your nationality but instead your place of permanent residence.
The processing of the residence permit application involves two phases.
First, the ELY Centre (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) assesses the profitability of your company based on your business plan and financing, among other things.
Then, the Finnish Immigration Service issues its decision on the residence permit.
The web pages of the Finnish Immigration Service provide more information on the preconditions for applying for an entrepreneur’s residence permit.

Start-up residence permit
If you would like to establish a start-up company in Finland, you can apply for a start-up residence permit intended for start-up entrepreneurs.
In order to gain a start-up residence permit, you must have a concrete business plan.
The process of applying for a start-up residence permit involves two phases:
You need an eligibility statement from Business Finland to serve as a start-up entrepreneur.
Apply for a start-up residence permit and visit a Finnish diplomatic mission or a Finnish Immigration Service office to establish your identity.
The process is very fast and smooth.
Business Finland, which provides support to businesses, will evaluate your company’s business model, competence and capability of growing its operations.
You can send the information regarding your business plan and the requisite documents to Business Finland electronically.
Once you have received a favourable assessment from Business Finland, you can apply for a start-up residence permit from the Finnish Immigration Service.
Deliver the statement to the Finnish Immigration Service as an appendix to your start-up residence permit application.
You cannot receive a start-up residence permit for Finland without a favourable assessment from Business Finland.

The Finnish Immigration Service: Presentation of the Enter Finland e-service
If you have a fixed-term residence permit (A or B permit) and the reason for your stay in Finland changes, you must apply for a new residence permit on new grounds.
If you have a permanent residence permit (P) in Finland, you do not need to change the grounds for your permit even when the reason for your stay changes.
A residence permit can be applied for on one of the following grounds:
Working
Studies
Family ties
Remigration
Finnish heritage
International protection
Other reason
You should bear in mind that the grounds for a residence permit can affect your rights in Finland.
For example, a residence permit granted based on a family tie includes a more extensive right to work than a permit granted based on studies.
How to change a temporary residence permit into a continuous one?
If you have a temporary residence permit (B permit), you can apply for a continuous permit (A permit) if the reason for your stay in Finland changes from temporary to continuous.
If you have been granted a temporary residence permit based on a family tie, you can apply for a continuous residence permit when the family member in question applies for one.
You can also apply for a continuous permit on other grounds if they are continuous.
If you have a temporary residence permit based on studies, you can only receive a continuous permit if the basis for your stay in Finland changes.
It is not possible to obtain a continuous permit based on studies.
The grounds for your stay can change, for example, if you obtain a job in Finland or marry a Finnish citizen or a person with a permanent or continuous residence permit for Finland.
If you have a temporary residence permit for the purpose of working or entrepreneurial activities, you can apply for a continuous residence permit when you have resided in Finland for a continuous period of two years.
How do I apply for residence permit on new grounds?
Choose the application form based on the grounds under which you are applying for a new permit.
Submit your application online in the Enter Finland service or at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service.
You can find more information about applying on the InfoFinland page Residence permit extension.
From a student to an employee
If you have completed a degree in Finland, you can receive a residence permit for job application.
Once you complete your studies and your student residence permit ends, you can apply for a permit extension (jatkolupa) for job application.
The permit is valid for 12 months.
The permit can only be granted once and cannot be renewed.
Once you find a job, you can apply for a residence permit based on employment.

If you have Finnish ancestry or a close connection with Finland, you may be granted a residence permit in Finland on this basis.
This means that you are considered a returnee (paluumuuttaja).
Receiving a residence permit depends on the directness and closeness of your Finnish ancestry.
No other reason, such as work or study, is required in order to receive the permit.
Persons who themselves have never been Finnish citizens but whose parent or grandparent is or has been a native Finnish citizen, are considered returnees (paluumuuttaja) of Finnish origin.
Former Finnish citizens are also considered returnees.

Applying for a residence permit
Being an entrepreneur in Finland
In Finland, anyone with a permanent residence in a country belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA) can start a business.
The need for a permit is not dependent on nationality but instead your place of residence.
If you are a citizen of an EU country, EEA country, Nordic country or Switzerland and wish to move to Finland to start a business, you do not require a residence permit.
Read more on the InfoFinland page EU citizens.
If you do not live in the EEA area and are a citizen of a country other than a Member State of the European Union, an EEA country or Switzerland, you will need a residence permit to become an entrepreneur in Finland.
Your business operations must be profitable, and your livelihood must be ensured by earnings from these activities.
You must apply for the first residence permit before you come to Finland.
Entrepreneur’s residence permit
If you want to work as an entrepreneur in Finland, you will need an entrepreneur’s residence permit.
The following are regarded as entrepreneurs:
start-up entrepreneur
sole proprietor, an individually-owned business
partner in a general partnership
active partner in a limited partnership
member of a cooperative who has an unlimited obligation to contribute
partner in an executive position in a limited company (managing director or board member) or some other corporation
In order to be eligible for a residence permit, you must personally work at your company in Finland.
If you do not have a permanent residence in Finland or elsewhere in the EEA area, you must register your business operations in the Trade Register of the Finnish Patent and Registration Office before applying for an entrepreneur’s residence permit.
If you move to Finland or the EEA area permanently, you will not require permission from the Finnish Patent and Registration Office to set up a business.
In other words, the permit is not dependent on your nationality but instead your place of permanent residence.
The processing of the residence permit application involves two phases.
First, the ELY Centre (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) assesses the profitability of your company based on your business plan and financing, among other things.
Then, the Finnish Immigration Service issues its decision on the residence permit.
The web pages of the Finnish Immigration Service provide more information on the preconditions for applying for an entrepreneur’s residence permit.

The process is very fast and smooth.
Business Finland, which provides support to businesses, will evaluate your company’s business model, competence and capability of growing its operations.
You can send the information regarding your business plan and the requisite documents to Business Finland electronically.
Once you have received a favourable assessment from Business Finland, you can apply for a start-up residence permit from the Finnish Immigration Service.
Deliver the statement to the Finnish Immigration Service as an appendix to your start-up residence permit application.

Quota refugees
You cannot apply to become a quota refugee (kiintiöpakolainen) through Finnish officials.
Nor is it possible to suggest another person, such as a friend or a relative, as a quota refugee.
As quota refugees, Finland accepts persons who are considered refugees by the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
Quota refugees are selected from among the persons proposed to Finland by the UNHCR.
The Finnish authorities interview the refugees proposed by the UNHCR and, on the basis of these interviews, select the persons who will be admitted to Finland.
Such interviews are performed in the refugees’ countries of residence, usually in refugee camps or the UNHCR’s premises.

Asylum seeker’s right to work
You can apply for asylum in Finland if you have a justified reason to fear persecution in your home country.
Reasons for the persecution can include origin, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinions.

Seeking asylum
You can apply for asylum in Finland only inside Finnish borders.
There is not a special asylum application form that you can submit in advance.
When you arrive in Finland, immediately tell the border control authority or police that you want to seek asylum.
The border control authority or police will register you as an asylum seeker, record your basic information and take your fingerprints.
Once an official has received your asylum application, you will be taken to a reception centre.
You can live there while the Immigration Service processes your application.
You can also live somewhere other than at the reception centre but you must pay for your housing yourself.
Seeking asylum in FinlandFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Asylum seeker from the European Union
In EU countries (and Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), you must apply for asylum in the first country that you enter.
If you applied for asylum or resided in another EU country (or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) before coming to Finland, your application will not be processed in Finland.
Instead, you will be turned back to the country you were in before coming to Finland.
This is called the Dublin procedure.
If you are a citizen of a European Union member state, you will probably not receive asylum in Finland.
Finland considers all EU countries safe for their citizens.
However, all applications of EU citizens are still investigated.
You can find information on how to move to Finland for reasons other than as an asylum seeker on the InfoFinland page EU citizens.

Asylum application processing
The Finnish Immigration Service will process your application and make the decision.
The Finnish Immigration Service will verify your identity and the route through which you travelled to Finland and assess whether you can receive asylum in Finland.
It is common for the processing to take several months.
Once you have applied for asylum, you have the right to stay in Finland for as long as it takes to process your application.
During that time, you cannot leave the country.
If you leave the country, the authorities may decide that your application is no longer valid.
The Finnish Immigration Service will send you an invitation to an asylum interview.
The invitation will state the language to which the interview will be interpreted, the exact address of the interview location and the time and date of the interview.
Processing of asylum applicationsFinnish _ Swedish _ English
Asylum interview
The asylum interview (turvapaikkapuhuttelu) is the most important event during the processing of your application.
During the interview, you will be asked about the events and reasons why you had to leave your home country.
It is important to give as much detail as possible about what happened.
Based on what you say, the Finnish Immigration Service will decide whether you will be granted asylum in Finland.
As an asylum seeker, you have the right to have a legal aid attorney in the interview.
The attorney will participate in the asylum interview at their own discretion.
If you need an interpreter, the Finnish Immigration Service will get one for you.

You can be granted asylum in Finland if the authorities think that you will be persecuted in your home country due to
origin
religion
nationality
membership in a specific social group, or
political opinion.
If you are not granted asylum, in some cases you can be granted a residence permit based on subsidiary protection.
You can be granted a residence permit based on subsidiary protection if you are at risk of:
death penalty or execution;
torture or other inhumane treatment or punishment; or
serious personal danger due to an armed conflict.
When you apply for asylum, the Finnish Immigration Service also investigates whether you could be granted a residence permit on other grounds.

Cancelling residence permitsFinnish _ Swedish _ English
In some cases, a Finnish citizen's family members other than spouses, common-law spouses, parents of a minor or minors themselves may also be eligible for a residence permit in Finland based on family ties.
The permit can also be granted to other family members of a person who has a residence permit based on international protection.
If the basis of your residence permit is something other than international protection, your family members are not eligible for a residence permit.
Other family members may be eligible for a residence permit, if they are entirely dependent on the family member residing in Finland.
On this basis, a permit can be granted for example to the parents of a person who has reached the age of majority (who has turned 18).
Financial dependency alone or poor health, however, are not considered grounds for granting a residence permit.
Another family member may also be granted a residence permit if he or she has led a stable family life with a family member residing in Finland before the family member arrived in Finland.
Another requirement is that this family life was interrupted for a serious reason, such as taking refuge.

Entrepreneur’s residence permit
Start-up residence permit
Applying for a residence permit
Being an entrepreneur in Finland
In Finland, anyone with a permanent residence in a country belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA) can start a business.
The need for a permit is not dependent on nationality but instead your place of residence.
If you are a citizen of an EU country, EEA country, Nordic country or Switzerland and wish to move to Finland to start a business, you do not require a residence permit.
Read more on the InfoFinland page EU citizens.
If you do not live in the EEA area and are a citizen of a country other than a Member State of the European Union, an EEA country or Switzerland, you will need a residence permit to become an entrepreneur in Finland.
Your business operations must be profitable, and your livelihood must be ensured by earnings from these activities.
You must apply for the first residence permit before you come to Finland.
Entrepreneur’s residence permit
If you want to work as an entrepreneur in Finland, you will need an entrepreneur’s residence permit.
The following are regarded as entrepreneurs:
start-up entrepreneur
sole proprietor, an individually-owned business
partner in a general partnership
active partner in a limited partnership
member of a cooperative who has an unlimited obligation to contribute
partner in an executive position in a limited company (managing director or board member) or some other corporation
In order to be eligible for a residence permit, you must personally work at your company in Finland.
If you do not have a permanent residence in Finland or elsewhere in the EEA area, you must register your business operations in the Trade Register of the Finnish Patent and Registration Office before applying for an entrepreneur’s residence permit.
If you move to Finland or the EEA area permanently, you will not require permission from the Finnish Patent and Registration Office to set up a business.
In other words, the permit is not dependent on your nationality but instead your place of permanent residence.
The processing of the residence permit application involves two phases.
First, the ELY Centre (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) assesses the profitability of your company based on your business plan and financing, among other things.
Then, the Finnish Immigration Service issues its decision on the residence permit.
The web pages of the Finnish Immigration Service provide more information on the preconditions for applying for an entrepreneur’s residence permit.

Business Finland, which provides support to businesses, will evaluate your company’s business model, competence and capability of growing its operations.
You can send the information regarding your business plan and the requisite documents to Business Finland electronically.
Once you have received a favourable assessment from Business Finland, you can apply for a start-up residence permit from the Finnish Immigration Service.
Deliver the statement to the Finnish Immigration Service as an appendix to your start-up residence permit application.
You cannot receive a start-up residence permit for Finland without a favourable assessment from Business Finland.
